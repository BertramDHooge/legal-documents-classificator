The Government Government does not lose sight of the fact that, in accordance with Article 3, § 2, of the Decree of 17 March2020, the draft decision to the chairman of parliament will be communicated before the known Makingervan in the Belgian Official Gazette (1) .2. It is proposed, even if Article 3bis, §1, paragraph 2, of the coordinated laws "concerning the Council of State" it does not formally prescribe, to publish a report to the government at the same time as the decision in which the scope and the concrete conspiracy of The decision is set out.3. Finally, in Advice No 67. 142/AG given on 25 March 2020 on a proposal that the law of 27 March 2020 "grants the Koningom to take measures in the fight against the distribution of the Coronavirus COVID-13 (i ) "And the Act of 27 March 2020" that authorizes the king to take measures in the fight against the spread of the Coronavirus COVID-19 (II) "has given the legislation in this wording commentary on the possibility of the Executive to look for a legal basis, both integrated permissions and in a legal provision that grants the executive power special powers: "8. The mandatory ratification of all decisions taken on the basis of the pre -established scheme, even when this is from legal point of view is not strictly necessary. For example, it is possible that the King is taking measures or makes changes to regulatory provisions of animals on the basis of the ACTU legislation are part of its authority, but nevertheless provides legal basis in Article 5, § 1, of the proposal, for example because these associated with measures for which for which for which they must indeed appeal to the special powers or because the Specialteningswethem is allowed to ignore the provisions formal requirements. As a result of the reinforcement, obtaining or changed provisions of law determined or amended provisions. They can then be changed by means of a formal law. The king will no longer be able to change them, even if a specific provision authorizes him to take measures in this regard. In the past, the Council of State, the legislation department, has always advised against making changes to Special Female Decisions (2) ". Article6 of the draft decision aims at the amendment to Article 2 of the Decree of the Walloon Government of 18 March 2020 by the lifting of two sentences. This decree of 18 March 2020 has Article 33bis/2 of the Decree of 12, according to his April 2001 as a legal basis. It is not based on the decree of 17 March 2020 and is not numbered. It is therefore a common decision of the Walloon governmentIt is true that the change of the latter would not have established the difficulties in its advice No 67.142/AG by means of a decision of special powers, based on the decree of 17 March 2020, since the intention of two sentences of article 2 of the decision of 18 March 2020 to be canceled and not to add new provisions or to change existing provisions. While the change Vandeze would last by means of a decision of special powers, based on the decree of 17 March2020, do not cause the difficulties that the Legislation Division has stated in its Advice No 67.142/AG, since the intention is to levy two sentences of Article 2 of the Decree of 18 March 2020 and not to change them by adding or existing or existing to change provisions. From the point of view of legal certainty, however, it would be better to omit Article 6 of the design and huh t if necessary to approve autonomously. If the author of the draft the decision of 18 March 2020 wants to give the character of a decision of special powers, devoured content of the decision of 18 March 2020 must be included in a decision of special poweringat based on the decree of 17 March 2020, just like the draft decision. On this point, it must be reminded of more erosion that the draft that the decision of March 18 has not been brought to the legislation department. In this application for advice, the text in which the content of this decision is included a decision of special powers, also not brought to the legislation department. It is therefore not up to the legislation department to speak out. a new first paragraph is inserted, reading as follows: In view of the decree of 17 March2020 to the granting of special powers to the Walloon Government in the context of the Health Crisiscovid-19, Article 1; ". 2. Since the decrees of 12 April 2001 and December 19, 2002 No legal basis for the draft decision, they will not be stated in the preamble in the form of a lift reference, but they can be mentioned in the Considerans.3. In paragraph 7, in the French draft version, the words "22 Avril" replaced by the words "20 Mai" .4. Deconsider channels will be placed in the prospective after the support. The preamble will be referred to kel 2.1. In the first paragraph, in Defran's draft version, "30 Juin 2020" must be written instead of "30 Juin" .2. In Hetweede paragraph, "au plus tard à la Date Mentionnéeà l'Alinéa 1er" must be written in the French design version and the words "à l'ssue de Ladite période" must be replaced by the words "àcette date". 3. Since the draft text must have a legislative value on the basis of the Decree of 17 March 2020 by adding a support mechanism in which the decrees of 12 April 2001 and 19 -December 2002 do not provide for the possibility of, where appropriate any other provision with a regulatory character. Consequently, in Lid4, in the French draft version, the words "par Dérogation à l'Article 30ter de l'ruRêté relatif au marchéde l'électricité et à l'Article 33ter de l'r arrêté relatif au Marché du Gaz "omitted. A commercial comment applies to Article 3, third paragraph. Article 3. The reasons for the general comments and for greater clarity it is recommended, in the French design version, the words" à la fin de la pértiode visée à l'Article 1er, Alinéa 1er, the l'rocté Dugouvertigement Wallon du 18 Mars Portant Sur des Mesures Urgentes and Matière the compteur à budget "AUterme de la Période Allant du 18 Mars au 30 Juin 2020 »or by the words" après le 30 juin 2020 ".

The economic lockdown and the recommendations they received are now and will later have a major influence on municipal finances, both the receptions and in terms of expenditure, both directly and indirectly, and this for all entities, and in particular the OCMWs There it is important to support the municipalities in their possibility, regardless of whether it is efforts in their participation in and supporting the fight against the epidemic and its consequences in the economic and social level, or to guarantee their finance force in The framework of the restart of their activities in the coming years. Budgetary soup: the local authorities are the first investors in the country. So it is important that their budgetary rules are also relaxed, so that they can continue to play their role of Motorin the economy. To relax these rules and respond to the various local situations, a percentage of shortage on the actual operating year is permitted For the 2020s to 2021, against 3% and 5% respectively. For municipalities that have normal reserves and/or a surplus of facilities, it will be possible to book them back to a hot operating year at the level of the permitted shortage. must fall. In that respect, the municipality must add an appendix to which the various items above can be read. In the framework of the budgetary supply, the amount of the facilities formed is particularly checked. The municipalities of the municipalities must justify the amounts, the amount and their maintenance. Taking into account the situation, the determined surplus will have to be included in the results if this requirement is due to the balance or must be included in the fund of the ordinary reserves or in a specific facility established in the context of the crisis. Municipalities): The basic principle is therefore the global balance of the ware budget. For the municipalities that no longer reach a global balance due to the consequences of the sanitary crisis, a specific assistance loan can be granted at the amount of costs (in receipts/expenditures) that The appendix states and checked, limited to the maximum percentages. The loan application will be made annually by 30 September of the year at the latest to the Aid Center and the Walloon Public Service Domestic Affairs and Social Action.

Loan for ordinary expenses Own Opcovid-19: the local authorities are in that capacity in primary care compared to deburgers and the local economy.

After all, the actual situation may differ from the regional and local condition in terms of economic relnance. Investments are undeniably an indispensable condition for the economic relnance. And the local authorities are the first investors in the country. It nevertheless serves to point out that these extraordinary reserves were built on the one hand when Vande Crisis was not yet there and on the other hand, based on the normal year of service. Investments are not the only lever for the Economic RelanceIt is also indispensable that they are getting rid of to act in the very short term and to be able to respond to the established terrain needs, without having to wait for longer periods that are accompanied by investments. To respond to the rule of the rule of the loan deviated, as is currently established for investments, to offer municipalities the possibility of being able to take loans for ordinary expenses that are specifically intended for the Economic Relance. After all, the situation is very varied, with regard to the formation of ordinary reserves, provisions of extraordinary reserves. Combining loans and extraordinary reserves may not exceed the upper limit of 100 euros per inhabitant on the 2020-2021. the reimbursement does not last longer than a maximum of 20 years, and In its certainly, the municipality is carried directly without any regional help. Evaluation: an evaluation is being carried out in front of 31 March 2021.

In addition, a state of affairs is also drawn up of the way in which the municipalities make rely on the various derogation schemes, and to the various relain measures taken. It is impossible to carry out both evaluation and reports if the collection of the different data is only at the end of the year and can be adopted with regard to the year 2020 but also with regard to the refined estimates for 2021. This evaluation will also be justified to determine any later measures.

On these three points, the following comments are made. Research of the draft hef1. Article 6 of the Special Law of 8 August 1880 "Determining reform of the institutions" should not be intended as this does not offer a legal basis for the present design.2. On the other hand, paragraph 1 of Article 1 of the Decree of 17maart 2020 must be intended, "to the granting of special powers to the Walloon government in the Framework for the Health Crisis COVID-19", that the Walloon Government, in addition to mentioning it Third Considerans, is authorized "to take all useful measures to prevent every situation that causes problems in the strict framework of the COVID-19 Pandemie and its consequences must be treated urgently on pain of serious danger". 3. A visa -relevant advice of the Council of State must be inserted for the Consider Opsen, reading as follows: "In view of advice No 64.466/4 of the Council of State, given on 2 June 2020, in accordance with Article 84, § 1, first paragraph, 2 °, of the laws on the Council of State coordinated on January 12, 1973; " (1). In the introductory sense, in the French version, the word "avec" must be replaced by the word "par". Paralagon 3 in the design must precede the sign "§ 3". ​​These comments apply to the continuation of the design. 2. article L1314-2, § 3, of the Code of Local Democracy and Decentralization (hereinafter: the Code), in Design, should, in the French version, ring as follows: «§ 3. Pardérogation au Paragraphe 2, L'Exercice Propre du Service Ordinaire (La Suite Comme Au Projet) ». In the continuation of this provision, in the French version, the expression" L'Emerercice Propre "is preferably used above" l'Exercice proprement this ". In that respect, the representative of the Minister confirms that concepts are equivalent. The same comment also applies to Article L1314-1, §5, paragraph 1, in draft (Article 3 of the draft). Article 2.1. In the first paragraph of article L1314-1, § 4, in design, in the French version, the concept of "Équilibreglobal Au Service Ordinaire" is used, which is not described in the CodeAccording to the representative The Minister is the "global" balance of which there is the balance as in the meaning of Article L1314-1, § 1, of the Code. The stater of the design is therefore requested to refer to this determination.2. The second paragraph of Article L1314-1, § 4, in the design, provides for the possibility of financial help from the government. According to the memorandum to the government, this help would be granted in the form of a loan from the regional aid center for the municipalities ( CRAC), where the regional guest is taking over.

This possibility deviates from any provision of the Code, but it is of Article 3, § 1, of the Decree of the Waalssekery of 5 July 2007 containing the General Regulations on the municipal compatibility for implementation of Article L1315-1 of the Local Democracy and Decentralization Code, the Decree, however, intends to design , to be based on the decree of 17 March 2020 and not on that article L1315-1, which the government is charged "the budget, financial and accounting rules of the municipalities and the rules in connection with the Further Avenue Ways of the acts of the offices of their accounting people to determine.

In Article 1, § 1, the government in the matters that fall under the competence of the Walloon Region take all use measures to prevent and treat every situation that causes problems in the strict frame-up COVID-13 and the consequences and that must be regulated on pain of serious danger.4It has therefore been proposed to the Walloon government to take all urgent measures from the operators charged with tourist activities to support the quality of life of the permanent consequences of the sanitary crisis on the Walloon economy. The same is the basis of their structure in an umbrella financial support program in the short term of which perimeter was determined on the basis of the executed tourist activities. The proposals are built around the following guidelines: - Provide cash to prevent pays from payments in creditors and side consequences and unsustainable economic situations to pent;-overhauling policy: the various tourist activities that have been suspended due to demit measures of the National Security Council; - the administrative burden of the treatment of the application files submitted for both the Tourism Commissariaat, which it will manage the regulation of Article 5.d, § 1, 1 °, of the Walloon Tourism Code, and for the beneficiaries as low as possible; - Ensuring budgetary control by projection mechanisms (cursors and maximum amounts) and the determination of awarded budgets. Being intended: -the activities in the event sector; - The activities in the Sights sector;- The activities related to accommodation in the Social Tourism sector. In addition, authorizations for a resumption of activities that the NVR could take will be accompanied by new-grazing requirements for which generic support will be offered. 5. The legislative technique of the special powers is taken into consideration. Due to the umbrella nature of the measures with an eye for smooth readability, a single decision is made by the government. All considered support includes this, with a legislative measure for making the right to support for each measure thereof, in addition, the implementing measures with regard to Namede granting criteria and rules. 6. On 2 June 2020, the Council of State, the legislation department, was requested by the Minister of Civil Service, Tourism, Heritage and Road Safety of the Walloon Region within a period of five working days on a draft decision of the Walloon government of Special POWS No. XX containing the support program for operators in the tourism sector in the framework of the sanitary crisis in connection with COVID-19. The advice of the Council of Statewerd issued on 9 June 2020 (advice 67/523/4) .7 .7. This decision is part of this context to determine a support program for the tourist operators.ii. Discussion of Articles Chapter I. - Increase in the subsidization of the houses for tourism for tourism for tourism for the realization of the actions and campaigns for the promotion of tourism in their office article 1 is aimed at, the subsidization of the houses for tourism, recognized By strengthening the Commissioner General for Tourism, for the implementation of the actions and campaigns for the promotion of tourism in their activity area, in the context of the Relance of the sector following the sanitary crisis caused by COVID-19. Article594.d of the Walloon Tourism Code provides for a subsidy percentage of the Houses for Tourism Furthermore The actions or campaigns for promotion of tourism in their 40% or 50% activity area (side actions that perform at least two houses for tourism together), with one Maximum amount determined corresponding procedure referred to in Article 595.d.d. The determination of an allowance percentage holds the facto a financial contribution of the houses for tourism that is in proportion to the percentages of the non -subsidized spending expenses. They must therefore have the financial capacity to cover these amounts in the form of their own receipts or other financial participations. In view of the announced perspectives as a result of the sanitary crisis COVID-19, tourist-conditioned must have all useful, attractive and complete information on activity signs they get to be read. The houses for tourism are the professional reference level before the tourism that ensures a swing of the territory of the Walloon Region. Thereom IS -Beslist to bring the subsidy percentage referred to in Article 594.d of the Walloon Tourism Code to 100%. This measure gives the houses for tourism the means to improve their assignments and the operational potential in terms of promotion to compensate for the consequences of the Sanitary Crisis COVID-19. The second paragraph provides for a condition for the grant of the subsidy to the houses for tourismThis condition strives to position the houses for Tourismor in the communication plan that will be introduced with a view to the Relance in the Sectora The sanitary crisis caused by COVID-19.kapreage II. - Subsidies for operators The tourist sector that generally organizes tourist events with a regional tourist zoning, for the costs related to the organization of events with a regional tourist destination that were canceled between 14 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 dedicated to a subsidy subsidy Coverage of the financial commitments that the tourist operators have approached in the context of the organization of event -related activities with a regional -tourist destination. Since the decision of the National Security Council of 12 March2020, which was adopted in the Ministerial Decree of 13 March 2020, all recreational, cultural, folkloric, sporting, private or public activities, regardless of its size, have been withdrawn from 14 Maarten to withdraw it canceled. The operators who generally organize event-related activities with a regional tourist destination can today have the available budgetary subsidies for the promotion of these activities based on the descriptive content of basic allocation 33.01 of the annual budgeting-general for tourism. The maintenance of the subsidization for the promotion man These canceled activities has become meaningless and can no longer be justified legally. Yet the organization of event -related activities with a regional -tourist destination must no longer be justified In addition to the promotion, financial commitments, mainly for the date of the programmed event (booking of the room, brewers, hygiene, safety, artist performance, etc.), from which the operators and subordinate boards cannot be bound by contracts. This financial support mechanism takes shape of a subsidization of the expenditure for each event prior to the date on which the measures of the National Security Council were announced, namely 12 March2020. In other words, all verbenses that entered into contractually with thirds before 14 March 2020 are eligible for the reference. A written contract is non -legisch. Transferring an invoice or an order form can prove the existence of a legal provision in a contractual framework. In that case, the invoice or order form must date from Voorden14 March 2020, unless there is a demonstrated by each legal remedy that there was indeed an OPEN DATE concluded in advance. Those expenses are not eligible if a deconectual commitment is an explicit cancellation clause of the obligation to pay. The expenses that are deleted by the organizer of the event due to an explicit cancellation clause, they cannot justify the grant of the subsidy. The existence of a clear cancellation clause ensures that the publication does not qualify, even if the organizer refrains, to invoke this clause and actually paid this edition. The legal commitment in a contractual framework must be concluded with a third party. This means that the co -confuser of the contract may not be part of the organizer of the tourist sector. The wage expenditure for staff members, employed by an employment contract, the organizer of the Tourist Office, are not eligible, nor are the expenditure for a director of the organizer of an event. The subsidies are settled after submission of the costs entered into, on the understanding that the actual payment can take place later. After all, the purpose of the measure is to ensure that the organizers of events have enough means of cash to compensate their suppliers. The granting of the subsidy is therefore not linked to the condition of the prior payment of the suppliers, but that payment, which will take place later, is essential. Section 3 provides for the conditions for the grant of this subsidy. These criteria for taking into account the event -related activity with a tourist impact are just the same as the criteria for the application, by the administrative case law of the Commissariaat General for Tourism, for the optional subsidy for the promotion. Thus are eligible for the measure, the operators who generally organize event -related activities with a tourist destination and a regional reachThe criterion of time -related return is decisive. Excluded and not intended are the activities of which of the cultural, sporting, environmental or still heritage-oriented event-related character predominantly. The event-related activities with a mainly local range are also excluded. The regional range of the event is assessed according to:- the number of participants in the event;- the direct and untrech regional economic effects;- the volume of the expenses entered into the operator for the organization From the event- the resonance of the event impressed the image of Wallonia as a destination. The activity should have taken place between March 14 ,2020 and 31 August 2020 included. The activity that would take place over several days and for which days are outside that period are eligible as at least one day in that period. Depending on the analysis of the various evaluation criteria regarding the regional range of the event-related activity, the support amount is submitted to the Minister of Tourism by the Commissioner General for Tourismer decision. In his advice 67,523/4, the Department of the Council of State considered it the fundamental elements of this regulation to precision disrupted. However, it must be mentioned that this authority to grant a subsidy will be in line with the stater of the text in a discretionary assessment authority. The legal doctrine has made a distinction between the bound authority and the discretionary authority with regard to subsidy: "The subsidy is introduced by the text (...) as well as by the implementing decisions, which serve to determine whether the authority of the subsidizing government is bound or discretionaris. If the amount of the subsidy, its allocation conditions and the beneficiaries are objectively described in it, it concerns a bound authority (...). (...). If the texts grant the subsidizing authority, it concerns a on the contrary a discretionary authority (...). " (J. de Beys, B. Gors et ch. Thiebaut, «la Procédure d'OtroTroi of Subventions» Ind. Renders (Dir.), Les Subventions, Brussels, Larcier, 2011, p. 310-311). this subsidization is aimed at being discretionary in nature: the subsidizing government has a spacious assessment authority both in terms of the recognition of the capacity of "operators of the tourist sector who generally have event -related activities with a regional tourist destination" and in terms of the concept of "regional tourist destination ". The same applies to the circumference of the tourist impact, which determines the subsidy amount. In practice, the subsidy decority will be able to boast administrative case law as it has been established in the award of subsidies to the tourist operators for events that are considered of regional importance. Pection 4 will discuss the obligation to serve a subsidy application. In order to limit the administrative steps that operators have to take as good as possible, the applications for an optional subsidy for the promotions, submitted for 14 March 2020 in the context of the promotion activities, are deemed to be applications that are valid in the context of The new allowance. Section 5 determines the subsidy amounts, determined as follows: € 6,000, € 10,000, € 15,000, € 20,000 or € 25,000. The correct amount is charged by the minister with tourism in function of the importance of the event -related activity for regional tourism. That importance is assessed against the light of the criteria referred to in Article 4, § 3, 3 ° (a) (number of participants, amount of financing, economic effects ...). Section 6 confirms the control authority of the Commissariaat General for Tourism. To make this check possible, the operator of the tourism sector or the subordinate board, in the appendix to the principle decision to grant the subsidy referred to in § 1, a declaration of the type of debt claim . The operator has the obligation to return that debt receipt declaration, properly completed, to the Commissariat General for Tourism. In the event of an excess amount, the tourist operator the part of the subsidy must repay that the amount that he actually paid for the organization of the cancellation activity exceeds. Incidentally, this is the confirmation of the general law principle that says that every subsidy intended for purposes other than those for which it intended is to be repaid. The operator has the obligation to pay his co -contracting -acting -acting, if appropriate after receipt of the subsidyHe must therefore be able to prove this payment and exposes a requirement for reimbursement of the subsidy amounts he is unable to at least prove the actual payment of expenses that are equivalent to subsidy amount. Chapter III. -Support for the tourism attractions admitted by the Commissariaat General for Tourism for the maintenance costs of Hunfrastructure during the period of compulsory closure for the public as a result of the measures of the federal government to limit the distribution of the Coronavirus COVID-19, paragraph 1, paragraph 1, refers to Article 1, 5 °. D of the Walloon Tourism Code, in which a definition of what is under a tourist point of view is understood: "5 ° tourist assistance: the place of destination, consisting of a set of integrated and clearly identified activities and services of a resistant infrastructure, which is regularly given change as a natural, cultural or recreational valuable core and which is installed with the goal tourists, day tourists and local visitors without receiving prior reservation; fairground attractions, places that simply offer equipment for rent, landscapes, cities, freely accessible places intended for mere sports practice, for The organization of spectacles, culture, sporting events or festivities are not a tourist sight ". This chapter should be considered in this definition referred to for the implementation of the support measure. By decision of the National Security Council of 12 March 2020, all tourist sights were concluded from March 15th. In the event of decisions of the National Security Council of 6 May, 13 May and 3 June, the reopening of the sights is programmed for some on 18 May, others on 8 June and others are still on July 1 with specific sanitary measures. For the period of suspension of their activities, the tourist sights have not collected any reception with entrance fees. The tourist sights have had to bear the same period costs for the maintenance and maintenance of their infrastructures, including somewhat permanent and therefore had to be made during the period of suspension of their activities. To support these operators, the government decides a financial support mechanism for the operators, to participate in covering the costs inherent in the maintenance of the infrastructures of the tourist sights ten Compared to the tourist weight of the interest involved. Section 2 provides for the conditions for the allocation of this support. Qualify for the measure, the operators authorized by the Commissariaat General for Tourism under Articles 110.d and following of the Waalstourisme Code on the date of entry into force of the decision. Section 3 provides deformal for the calculation of the support amount. It is assumed that the receipts are bound by the admission prices a minimum cover for the costs bound by the infrastructures of debtorizers, without which the profitability of the activities cannot be guaranteed. Consequently, the adopted methodology for the calculation to determine the amount of the support assigned to the operators. Criteria that are taken into consideration:- Daily average of debting visits over the year (paying visitors 2019/365);- Fixed amount for each paying visit, intended for maintenance of the infrastructures: € 1.25; is, with a maximum of 86 days. The amount of the support, awarded to the operators, is determined by multiplication of these three factors. The day average of the paying visits is calculated on the basis of the paying visits to 2019. That number of visitors Calculated over the calendar year 2019 (from January 1 to 31 January 2019), and without a deliberation of the entire duration of the Tourist Activity of the Establishment, to maintain a common and simple calculation rule. In order to objectify the number of visitors and to guarantee equal treatment, the number of visitors is right "in Tempore Non Suspecto" the number provided by the operator in accordance with Article 131, 11 °, of the Code, reading: "The permit holder provides the Commissariat General for Tourism of January 31 of each year of each year The data on the tourist visitor numbers of the past storage year, including the economic indicators and according to the manner determined by the Commissariat-General for Tourism "The calculation method for visitors was recorded by the "Observatoire Wallon Dutourism" on the basis of statistical standards, so that this applies equal application for all operators. At the request of the "Observatoire Wallon du Tourisme", which questions the sights with the visitor numbers, the season tickets are not charged on every visit, but only when purchasing them. So there is no frequent calculation: each subscription counts for one visit. The maximum number charged closing days, namely 86, was calculated in function of the Periodevan 14 March to 7 June 2020. Here it must be mentioned that that number, taking into account force factors , up to a maximum of 86, the number of days on which the sight is connected is counted in calendar days. The fact that the sight anyway on some those days would have been closed (weekly or seasonal closing days, etc.) has no effect. Finally, the amount of the awarded support may not be lower than € 1,000, nor higher than € 200,000. - Support of the VoorSocial Tourism Associations, recognized by the Commissariat General for Tourism, for maintenance costs for Hunitrastructures for Tourist Bedsidketketketie from 14 March 2020 to 7 June 2020 article4, paragraph 1, aims to support the associations for social tourism-in-law In Article 1, 48 °, of the Walloon Tourism Code (in which Social Tourism is described as "the leisure and holiday activities that are organized by an association in such a way that every person, and more in particular the economic and culturally reduced Correction, the best practical terms are offered to actually gain access to those activities ") and that recognition under Article 313.d of the Walloon Tourism Code on the date of entry into force of the decision for the maintenance costs of their tourist accommodation infrastructures incurred during the period from 14maart 2020 to 7 June 2020 during W Every these accommodation -expiring establishments for the public were connected for the successive decisions of the federal government. This support is deposited on the Association for Social Tourism itself, since it is the only recognized market participant (who presents the legal personality) in the sector in the Walloon Tourism Code. Section2 provides for the award conditions. It should be mentioned: - For what the hotel system, the accommodation activities were not suspended by the federal government; -For the regional accommodation provision, the activities are either in the main activity with professional income under a legal statute that made the benefit of the support measure to the same -way measure and the SMEs, established by the government, possible, either if activities in secondary vocational value do not form main activity (no main income ); - With regard to accommodation, not authorized by the Commissioner General for Tourism, they escape completely and to control the tourist activities by the Comissariat and are not subject to any reporting of tourist main activities. For these reasons, the categories of as well as the measure are not eligible for the measure. Incidentally, under the numerous consequences of the sanitary crisis, special attention should be paid to tourists with an economically weakened portfolio for whom the use of accommodation in social tourism is not a pure choice, but The only way out is. The operators in social tourism offer quality vollelogy provisions at a solidarity price. The government has therefore decided to support them with a financial support that they can offer quality vollelogies in the resumption of activities maintained to the transfer of the costs incurred for the maintenance of these accommodation -expanded period of suspension of their activities, at the proposed prices to be able to be able to temper. Paralards provides the formula for the calculation of the support amount. The calculation method proposed to determine the amount of the support granted to the operators for social tourism is established with chapter 4, "support for the maintenance of the infrastructure of the tourist sights". Based on the principle that the Commissariaat General for Tourism does not have the specific visiting figures for every accommodation in the social tourism, the criterion that is linked to the daily average of the paying visitor is nevertheless replaced by the bed capacity of the accommodationThe receptions in connection with the price of the overnight stays at least cover the costs associated with the maintenance of the accommodation provisions in social tourism, if the profitability of activity maintains. Criteria that are taken into consideration: - capacity of delogy provisions regarding number of beds: - flat -rate amount set for each paying accommodation, intended for maintenance of the accommodation provisions: € 1.25; period from March 18 to June 7. The amount of the support, assigned to the operators, is determined by multiplication of these three factors. Chapter V. - Support for some tourist institutions, tourist accommodation and tourist sights authorized or recognized by the Commissariat General for Tourism for the costs concerning the introduction of the sanitary measures that are compulsory for the activities of the activities to be resumption of the activity thin to be accompanied by the sanitary measures established by the federal government as a result of the National Security Council of 3 June 2020. article 5 Purpose of the aid for costs for the introduction of the sanitary measures is required for the resumption of activities. Detoerist operators who were given the introduction of sanitary measures as a condition for the resumption of activities will have to make expenditure that the government proposes to participate. PARAGRAAF 1 Bakent off the potential beneficiaries of this support. This concerns tourist accommodation, associations for social tourism and tourist sights authorized or recognized by the Commissariaat General for Tourism. Pection 2 points to the conditions that the actor intended in paragraph 1 must meet in order to get the support. For that support are eligible for being eligible The tourist operators are authorized by the Commissariat General for tourism on the date of entry into force of the decision and at the time of liquidation of the support. of the support, the proof that the application for renewal of the authorization has been submitted. Incidentally, the operator will have to commit to it, the sanitary measures, at the time of submitting the request for support by the federal government, Nate Life. Section 3 elaborates on the calculation of the granted amount granted, determined per category or subcategory operators from the tourism sector. The amounts of the awarded support are fixed in no time in function of the activities that the operators provide, and for some of them, a rato of the tourist weight of the activities they provide, with maximum amounts per scale. The following calculation method was determined: - accommodation blocks -under rent money (tourist accommodation in the countryside, staying on the farm, holiday homes in the city and furnished holiday homes): 600 € lump sum per authorized accommodation for rent scheme; , located at the same operating location;- Hotel furnishings Road-to-tour tourist weight with reference to the residential units: 1,000 € fixed + 10 € per room;- Campsites a rato of the tourist weight under reference to camping pitches: 1,000 € fixed + 5 € per camping site;-- Holiday villages A rato of the tourist weight under Reference to the number of residential units: 1,000 € fixed + 10 € per residential unit; login provisions for social tourism, a rato of the tourist weight with reference to the number of beds: 1,000 € fixed + 10 € per bed; - sights, rato of the tourist weight with reference to the number of paying visitors: 1,000 € fixed + € € 0.2 per paying visitors, in windows for the rest of the tourist period (daily average of the paying visitors of the year 2019 multiplied by the number of days between the opening date access by the federal government, namely 18 May 2020, 8 June 2020 or 1 July 2020, and 30 November2020 included). The end of the tourist period will be established on November 30, 2020s and a realistic agreement is with the closure of most sights. PARAGRAAF4 confirms the control authority of the Commissariat General for Tourism. An A PosterioriControle about the actually made expenses can be implemented, with the obligation to repay for the operators, where appropriate, for the part of the support that the amount of the expenditure is made. Chapter VI- Further rules for submitting the subsidy and support request in chapters 2 to 5 article 6 provides for further rules for submitting the subsidy and support applications. Only the applications submitted on the basis of the type forms, determined by the Commissariaat General for Tourism, are receptive.

Chapter VII. - Final and transitional provisions article7 stipulates that the decision comes into effect the day after adoption thereof by the Walloon Government.artikel8 stipulates that the minister is responsible for tourism charged with the implementation of this Decree .______cates1 Art. 5D of the Walloon Tourism Code. «§ 1. The Commissariaat General for Tourism is responsible for: 1 ° the implementation of the general tourism policy of the government; ...". Advisory of the Council of State No. 67.523/4 of 9 June 2020 Department of legislative on 2 June 2020werd the council van State, legislation department, by the Minister of Civil Service, Computer Science, Administration Simplification, charged with child benefit, tourism, heritage and road safety of the Walloon Regional search within a period of five working days to issue advice on a draft decision from Dewalle Government `of special powers no. ... concerning the support program for operators in the tourist sector in the context of the health crisis covid-19'. The design was investigated by the Deaviered Chamber on 9 June 2020. The room was composed of Martine Baguet, chairwoman Vande Kamer, Luc Cambier and Bernard Blero, State Councils, and Anne-Catherine van Geersdaele, clerk. Reporting was released by Benoit Jadot, first auditor departmental. The advice with the following text was issued on 9 June 2020. According to Article 84, § 1, first paragraph, 3 °, of the laws `on the Council of State ', coordinated on January 12, 1973, the request for advice should be in the special motives specified that justify the urgent character. Writing as follows: "In view of the urgent necessity, inspired by the fact that the measures, announced by the National Security Council of 12 March 2020 and the Ministerial Decree of 23 March2020 containing urgent measures to limit the distribution of the Coronavirus COVID-19 Met the cancellation of all activities of cultural, festive, folkloric, sporting, tourist and recreational nature, as well as the closure for the public of the tourist operators from March 14, 2020; that the tourist operators were suspended activities or canceled with maintenance costs for their infrastructure or expenses that are fixed were laid for the decision of the National Security Council of 12 March 2020; that they are dealing with the absence of revenue, which reduces cash and there is a lack of liquid resources; That the strikes of payments to the creditors of the tourist operators and related consequences are in danger of, with any unbearable economic consequences; that the resumption of the activities of the tourist operators means that the introduction of sanitary measures should therefore take urgent measures to be taken to be favored by the tourist operators to support their quality of life and to prevent a mass-movo effect on the Walloon economy; that these support and subsidies may be paid immediately and that the urgent necessity is therefore justified ". The request for advice is submitted to that based on Article 84, § 1, paragraph 1, 3 °, of the laws `on the Council of State ', coordinating top January 12, 1973, the legislation department limits its investigation into the law of the draft, to the authority of the stater of the deed and to complete the prior form requirements, according to Article 84, § 3, of the aforementioned coordinated laws. On these three points, the draft gives rise to subsequent comments. Meaning remark for the conditions for the grant of the subsidies and the support, as they are deemed to be regularly deemed in the chapters 3 to 7 of the draft decision, this means that measures that must or should have applied the subsidy and support applicants as a result of decisions of the National Security Council. The chapters 3 to 5 also declare the periods in which these measures had to be applied to grant the granting of the subsidies and support that are possible to make it possible. This gives the following general comments: 1Pursuant to Article 3 (1) of the Royal Decree of 28 January 2015 `establishing the National Security Council ', the Council determines the General Information and Security Policy, assures its coordination and determines the priorities of the Intelligence and Security Services". plays a decisive role in determining the measures to limit the distribution of the Coronavirus COVID-13. However, it must be established that the decisions made by the council naturally do not have a legally mandatory scope. Other decisions must be taken to determine the measures to limit the distribution of COVID-19 through provisions with compelling force. For example, as indicated, as indicated in the memorandum and in the Walloon government, various successive decisions of the Federal Minister of Security and Home Affairs were adopted and to "formalize" the measures taken by the National Safety Council. It is therefore recommended that the decision in the draft decree is specifically referred to the decisions of the National Security Council. DEBESTE SOLUTION would be previously referred to in this: a) in a generic way to the measures taken by the federal government to spread the Coronavirus Covid- 19 to limit; b) or, where it is useful or necessary for the understanding of the decision in design, accurately refer the mandatory federal provisions that the measures considered in the text will impose 2..2. whatever is the task of the government to make sure that there is no mistake whatsoever in mentioning the correct periods in which the Subsidy and support applicants The measures that were determined to be able to claim the benefit of the aforementioned subsidies and support should have to apply. In that respect it should be noted: a), as confirmed by the minister's Deputy, in chapters 4 and 5 (Articles 5 and 6) The date of 8 June 2020 replacement must be made by the date of 7 June 2020; b) or that there is uncertainty when it comes to the starting date of the period that must be considered for the application of Chapter5 ( Article 6): While the disposing part mentions the date of 14 March 2020, the Walloon Government is then again involved in the date of March 18, 20203.3. The draft decision serves to take into account these comments. Special commercial trees of a decision are the first provisions to be aimed at, provisions that the decision of a legal basis. Therefore, the decree of 17 `to the granting of special powers to the Walloon government must be intended for the Walloon Tourisms of the Tourisms of the Tourisms of the Tourisms of the Health Crisis. For tourism permanently charged with a new assignment. If the provision of this way is conceived, it would exceed the special powers, as assigned to the government in the Decree of 13 March 2020, to the extent that it would not limit itself to "[taking] all useful measures ( ...) to prevent and treat every situation that causes problems in the strict framework of the COVID-19 Pandemie and its consequences and that must be regulated on an impression of serious danger ", as stipulated in Article 1, § 1, of the The decree of 17 March 2020. DisinTie of the government, however, manifest is different. After all, according to the report to the Walloon Government, this provision "in the Walloon Tourism Code of confirming the authority of the Commisariaat-General for Tourism on the support of the operators in the tourism sector, in order to provide the assignments entrusted to him at this decision with a legal basis ". These new assignments, as regulated in chapters 3 to 7 of the draft decision,, however, are awarded to the government in the special powers of the Decree of 17 March 2020. The Walloon Tourism Code does not have to change this: on the one hand, the decision in design complies the authority of which there is a way to the Commisariat General for Tourism; On the other hand, as confirmed in the Walloon Government report, the new assignments are assigned to the Commission General for TourisMeeds in the context of the general assignment to implement the general government policy as with Article5.d, § 1, 1 °, of The Walloon Tourism Code entrusted to the said body must therefore be omitted. Item article 2. Provisional provision must be elaborated, only, the scope of the "Communication Plan determined with a view to the Relance of the sector following the sanitary crisis by COVID -19 "That is why it is better to summarize this provision, earlier in the Walloon Tourism Code, as an autonomous provision. In addition, to be accurately specified, who seems to be the plan that is established. to be applied without restricting, to resume the wording of Article 1, § 1, of the Decree of 17 March 2020, a situation that causes problems in the strict framework of the COVID-19 Pandemie and the consequences of it and Diegegegef be penalized of serious danger ". The elected words indicate an exceedance of the special powers, granted to the government in the decree of 17 March 2020. The determination must be revised in shape and content in order to remain within the limits of these powers. Ware form, this means that it should not seem to be aimed at the overall replacement of Article594.d, § 2, of the Walloon Tourism Code. Anyway i s it better to insert this provision, rather than them in the Walloon Tourism Code, as an autonomous determination.artikel4.1. In present provision, it is lacking in accuracy on various fundamental selections of the regulation that it provides. This is how this provision lacks an accurate determination and a sufficient framework of the conditions that can be met in order to be able to control these persons as covered with the capacity of "operators of" operators of "operators The tourist sector that usually organizes event -related activities with a regional tourist destination "and that they can claim them on the benefit of the subsidy considered in the text. For example, the concept of itself "operators of the tourism sector" is not described. With regard to the question of whether an event -bound activity has a "regional tourist destination", it is stated in sections 3, 3 °, a) that various criteria to be merged, but these criteria - "number of participants", "Financing amount per operator of the tourist Sector "," amount of the direct and indirect economic effects "and" the contribution to the development of the tourist image of Wallonia "are itself very vague. The condition contained in the "usually" organization of the activities stated in the text also suffers from a lack of precision. Department of legislation further further on that paragraph 5, by making the "size" of the "tourist impact without any precision" "Of the activity concerned against the criteria referred to in paragraph3, 3 °, a), insufficient indications of the rules to be observed with a view to determining the amount of the applicable subsidy.2. Section 2 and paragraph 3, 2 °, demand that the grant application has entered into commitments "in a contractual framework with third parties".
