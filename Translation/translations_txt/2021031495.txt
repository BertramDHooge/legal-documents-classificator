This additional reduction replaces the additional reduction as referred to in Article 154, CIR 92. Article 147, fourth paragraph, of the CIR 92 stipulates that if the tax on pensions and other replacement income for a certain assessment year after application of the reductions for pensions and replacement income is reduced to zero for a taxpayer with a taxable income that is equal to 10,160 euros ( Basic amount) and only consists of pensions and other replacement income, the king the amount of the additional reduction increases to the amount that is necessary to reduce the tax zero.

The basic tax is thus reduced by 2,262.50 euros (9,050 euros x 25 pCt.) To 2,222.50 euros (for slane tax). The sum of the ordinary and additional reduction for pensions and other replacement income, i.c. 1.841.96 + 378.96 = 2,220.92 euros, is just not sufficient to bring the amount of the tax due after application of the reductions for pensions and other replacement income zero zero . In accordance with Article 147, fourth paragraph, of the CIR 92, the indexed amount of the supplementing reduction for pensions and other replacement income must therefore be increased for the 2022 with 1.58 euros tax year to 380.54 euros. This Decree implements this.

The indexation coefficientis referred to in Article 178, § 3, third paragraph, 2 °, WIB 92 for the tax year 2022 equal to 1,6032. To reach an indexed amount of 380.54 euros, the basic amount of 236.38 euros must be increased to 237.36 euros.

In wartime or in the same periods, refusal or omission is to behave according to the measures for the application of Article 185 have been ordered punished with prison sentence of three months to six months with a fine of five hundred euros to a thousand euros, or with one of one of the penalties only. Deminister or, where appropriate, the mayor or the zone commander, can also have the stated ball of the posts executed, at the expense of the opponent or in default persons. "In article 11 of the law of 15 May 2007, to which is referred to In Article 181, § 1, of the same law, the various general assignments of the operational services of the Civil Security Eals follows: "§ 1. [...]: 1 ° the rescue and assistance to persons threatening circumstances and the protection of their goods; 2 ° the urgent medical assistance provision as determined in Article 1 of the law of 8 July 1964 on urgent medical assistance; 3 ° the fight against fire and explosion and their consequences; 4 ° the rebelining of pollution and the release of hazardous substances including radioactive fabrics and ionizing radiation; 5 ° the logistical support. § 2 Making integral part of the assignments listed in § 1, 1 °, 3 °, 5 °, the proactions, prevention, the preparation, performance and the evaluation.

"9." . The concrete scope of the different legal grounds just mentioned, with regard to the jurisdiction of the federal government, has made the object of a general analysis by the general meeting of the department ING legislation of the Council of State in the aforementioned advice 68,936/AV given on 7 April 2021 on a preliminary draft of 'pandemie law'. Current measures in the fight against the COVID-19 Pandemie currently gives rise to controversy both in doctrine and in case law, which is the cause of any legal uncertainty, in particular in terms of the case law of the ordinary courts and courts. For example, a judgment of the correctional court of Charleroi (5) and a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Bergen, (6) in which it was considered that the existing ministerial decisions were not had to be put aside. The French -speaking court of first instance of Brussels, on the other hand, has notified in a decision of 31 March 2021, declared the proceedings, that the ministerial decisions of 18 and 28 October 2020 did not, however, appeal to that decision against that decisionIn that context that the minister has taken the initiative for the Interior to work the preliminary design of 'PandemieWet' the preliminary draft, which preliminary design is to provide a clear coherent legal framework in order to be able to deal with "epidemic emergencies in the future ", in the sense as defined in that preliminary draft of law.10.1. The general meeting of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of a claim for suspension in the context of the COVID-19 Pandemic, among other things, also noticed the following (8): "10. (10. ...) Pursuant to Article 4, first paragraph, of the Act of 31 December 1963, which applies both in wartime and peace time, the Minister from the inside of the Netherlands organizes the means and provokes the measures that are required for the whole country of territory for the civilian protection. She coordinates the preparation and application of that measures in the various ministerial departments as with the public bodies. The 'civil protection' aims not only to ensure the protection and continuation of the population, as well as the indemnification of the country's patrimony in wartime but also to provide assistance and assistance in peacetime case of disastering events, catastrophes and damage eexs such as fires, floods and other such disasters (Parl. St., Senate, 1961-1962, 338, 2). Under such catastrophes, infections with a living virus can also be understood, such as the infection with SARS-COV-2DIE leads to COVID-19. The fact that infections with a life -threatening virus are also conceived by emergency planning also seems to be supported in the Royal Decree of 31 January 2003 that, as is mentioned above, in his preamble refers to various crisis situations including infectious diseases. According to article 3 of the Law of 15 May 2007 includes the 'civil security' all civil measures and resource needed for the completion of the assignments stated in the law to come to the rescue and protect at all times persons and their living environment. "Civil measures" are the measures that are neither of a police nor of a military nature (Article 3 in conjunction with Article 1, §2, 7 °, of the law of 15 May 2007). In the event of imminent circumstances, the minister or his authorized representative, to ensure its protection, may oblige themselves to remove places or strokes that are particularly exposed, threatened or affected, and those who have been involved in these measures designate a provisional place of residence; For the same reason he can prohibit any movement or any traffic of the population '(Article 182 of the law of 15 May 2007). Refusal or omission to support the measures ordered in application of (among other things) Article 182, Peace Time is punished with prison sentence of eight days to three months, and with a fine of twenty -six euros to five hundred euros, or with one of those penalties alone (Article 187, first paragraph). The minister or, where appropriate, the mayor or the zone commander, can also have the Saeping measures ex officio, at the expense of the perseverance or in default (Article 187, last paragraph) .11. In addition, the Minister of the Interior and the Gouverneurop of the law of 5 August 1992 also exercise powers on administrative police. In accordance with Article1 of that Act, they practice, and this without prejudice to the powers that have been granted by law (as, as, in these, the powers of civil security), the powers of the mayor in subsidiary order (among other things) 'when the disruption of public order out of the territory of several municipalities or, even if, even if the event or display is only located in a single municipality, the public interest requires their intervention. 42 of the law of 7 December 1998 `to the organization of an integrated police service, structured on two levels of administrative police within the meaning of Article 3, 1 °, of the same law. (Police) measure in the meaning of Article 3, 1 °, of the Law of 5 August 1992 is understood to mean `any legal or material -lit -setting act of administrative or judicial police that serves an indication, an obligation or prohibition for citizens established that on the basis of Article 135, § 2, second paragraph, 5 °, of the new Municipalities Act, it is the task of the municipalities to provide for a good police, in particular about toilet, the Health, Division and Rest on public roads and places and in public buildingsMore specifically, the following store of police is entrusted to the vigilance and authority of the municipalities, `5 ° take appropriate measures to prevent disasters and pests, such as fire, epidemics and epizoötiën and providing the necessary help to make them stop ' . In subsidiary Order `When the disruption of the public order extends over the territory of various municipalities or, even if, even if the event or the situation is only located in a single municipality, the public interest requires their intervention, that task and the associated Exercise of police authority attributes the Minister of Interior cases (Article 11 of the Act of 5 August 1992). (...) "In the same judgment of 30 October2020, it was then noted that the challenged measures, namely the" Mandatory Closure of the Horeca, with the exception of peripheral activities "for a month," seems to be felt in Article 11 of the Act of 5 August 1992 directly allocated to the Minister, the general legal principle contained in Article 105 of the Constitution seems to have been paid in itself ". It was also considered that" a prohibition of movement is being imposed in the clasp imposed in the sense of Article 182 of the Law of 15 May 2007 under which the Minister can oblige the population, to ensure its protection, in case of vanding circumstances, in which places that are particularly exposed, threatened or affected and even, what the consequence of a ( all) lockdown, for the same reason any relocation or any traffic of the population can be able to improve "(9) 10.2. In some later Arres Ten, always pronounced in the context of a claim to suspend in the event of extremely urgent necessity, has been judged in a similar sense with regard to the closure of the hospitality industry (10) and the closure of certain gambling establishments (11) .10.3. In another judgment of 30 October 2020, the General Meeting of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division, also in the context of a claim to suspend in the event of extremely urgent necessity that it was argued that the minister, partly in the light of the in Article 14 of the Constitution contained legality principle in criminal cases, hair powers had taken into account the establishment of a temporary curfew was not serious. (12) In doing so, the Council of State marked that "the provisions of the law of 31 December 1963 on the remediation of persons and goods, the measures To evacuation of certain places or the insulation measures "have been transferred to Title XI of the Law of 15 May 2007 and that in the Explanatory Explanation Memorandum, Provisions of the Law of 31 December 1963 stated that" the special disasters in which the aforementioned is ample authority The minister is given (...) The cases in which `There is danger VoorradioActiv ISITY or for infection exists' (Parl.st. Senate 1961-1962, Piece 338, 5) "belong. (13) 10.4. From what precedes and from the existing legal grounds that the minister is responsible for the Interior expressed the authority to act in this regard, can be derived, of course below reservation of a possible constitutional assessment of the delegation to the minister who would have to carry out the Constitution Court in this regard (14) and subject to a final judgment by the Divisional Law of the Council of State or of the Court of Cassation on the scope of the legal basis of the Ministerial Decree of 28 October 2020, that the minister's intervention is competent for interior cases in the context of the Coronapandemie may in principle be accepted on the basis of one or the other legal basis, or a combination of these different legal grounds, including Meerelkens the taken taken can be qualified as a place or travel ban, where it m ITS compliance with one or more conditions or modalities is still admitted to being at a certain place or to go to a certain place.11. Based on the above, it is assumed that the designed changes in Articles 1 to 5 and 8 of the draft can be deemed to find sufficient legal basis in the preamble of the designed ministerial decision -receiving various legal provisionsMost of them may in particular be considered as a regulation for which the parties involved are obliged to "remove themselves from places or regions" or where "each installation or any traffic of the population" is forbidden, albeit that it is always a place or displacement ban to which a complex system of conditions is linked: Article 1 of the design arranges the conditions for shopping with more than one person; Article 2 concerns the mandatory decision or the possible opening of certain commercial matters where the distance of 1.5 meters between the service provider and the consumer cannot be guaranteed, as well as the services to and in the house; Article 4 concerns the extent to which persons, on the territory, can come together; Article 3 and Article5 of the draft levy rules with a comparable scope. Article 8 of the draft the possibility, under certain conditions, to deviate from the rules contained in the ministerial decision of 28 October 2020 in the context of test and pilot projects. Insofar as the rules of which can be deviated from on the basis of the determined provision of the legal basis in the provisions listed in the preamble, those legal provisions also offer legal basis for Article 8 of the draft. In so far as the deviation relates (or may) to other parts Of the ministerial decision of 28 October 2020, the legal basis must in principle be sought in the legal provisions that can also offer legal basis for the provisions in question.13. Article 6 of the draft changes in Article27, § 4, of the Ministerial Decree of 28 October 2020, the reference to other provisions of that decision, so that the officials of the General Directorate of Economic Inspectorate of the Federal Public Service Economy, K.M.O., Midden and Energy are added additional made for the investigation and determination of infringements of Articles 5 and 8, § 1, of the Ministerial Decree of 28 October 2020.degisgevige explained the objective of this provision as follows: "Article 6 of the draft vessel an extension of the control authority of the General Directorate Economic Inspectorate, which will also be able to act as a result of reports that it receives from consumers or companies in the establishments mentioned in that provision. (...) The Economic Inspectorate checks, among other things, for the albuming of measures arising from the MB (and, if necessary, on concreteized ones measures arise the sector protocols). "The VRA However, AG arises from which legal provision the minister derives the authority for the Interior of the authority, in addition to the police officers of the local and Federal Pleitie, officials of the General Board to grant the authority regarding the investigation and adoption of infringements of the ministerial decision of 28 October 2020. die With regard to the General Directorate Economic Inspectorate, authority cannot be deduced from book XV ("Law Enforcement") of the Code of Economic Law. For example, Article XV.2 of that Code is authorized to the Minister's Primary Economy (and not the Minister competent for the Interior) to appoint civil servants for the "Investigation and adoption of infringements of this Code, of his implementing decisions of the regulations of the European Union for which this book provides sanctions, with the exception of the provisions included in Book IV and its implementing decisions ". Also the provisions on the special powers of those officials in Articles XV.10/1 and following of the Code of Economic Judications are not the possibility of making them competent for the investigation and adoption of provisions of the Ministerial Decree of 28 October 2020. In accordance with Article XV .10 of the Code of Economic Law, in a decision, after consultation in the Council of Ministers, the King may grant specific powers to the aforementioned official -steaming in order to detect and determine infringements, provided that Royal Decree is confirmed within 18 months of its entry into force at law. However, no use is made of that possibility in the designated ministerial decision, unless a Royal Decree is first worked out to implement the latter legal provision. Article 4 of the Act of 31 December 1963 stipulates that the Minister is responsible for the Domestic Affairs, coordinating the application of the application of the civil protection measures that are necessary for the whole of the country's territory, both at the various ministerial departments and at the public bodies. However, the Council of State believes it should doubt whether such a general provision can be supported to officials of those ministerial departments to grant the authority to investigate the establishment of infringements of the ministerial decision of 28 October 2020It is therefore advisable to create a more certain legal basis for this. To that respect, it can be sought to it for Article 8, 4 °, of the preliminary draft of 'Pandemie Act' stipulating that the supervision of compliance with the measures taken to implement Articles 4 and 5 of those are taken to be adopted is insured by under More that General Directorate Economic Inspection.B. Jurisdiction14. The General Meeting of the Legislation Department recently reminded 68,936/AVvan 7 April 2021, the following: "The authority to combat an epidemic emergency is not a power that as such exclusively to one government the federal, the community or the regional-has been allocated. As the Council of State, the legislation department has already recalled (15) and also reminded during the current COVID-19 Pandemie (16), `Each government is responsible for combating a public health crisis within the limits of its material powers. (17) '(...) In the fight against an epidemic emergency, Federal Government is taking measures in the context of its powers regarding:- the health policy;- the enforcement of public order, in particular Health Enforcement (Sanitary Police)-- Civil Protection and Civil Security-- control of the BU ITEN boundaries; sanitary measures in the context of other federal powers ". In the case of the casu, there are different measures that the present design aims to relax within the scope of the federal powers on sanitary police, civil protection and/or civil safety. In the case of the general meeting of the Legislation department in its advice 68,936/AV The following: "On the basis of its extensive authority on sanitary police, civil protections, the federal government has issued measures in the past that have a major impact on policy areas that have the competence of the communities and/or deGewests. For example, the federal government, in the past, has taken measures in the fight against an epidemic emergency situation such as the conclusion of educational institutions, prohibiting cultural events or only keeping the schools open or only allowing the cultural events under certain sanitary conditions (number of participants, mouth mask and social distance requirement, etc.). Although these measures have a clear sanitary dimension, they can, due to their federal government, only be taken by the federal government when the most important aspect of their efforts can be deemed to be deemed to relate to the sanitary police, the Civil protection and/or civil security, for which the federal government is competent. It happens to the Council of State that the latter will only be the case if triple conditions are met. In first place, the federal government must always respect the proportionality principle in the exercise of her powers. This general principle, which is associated with the federal loyalty of the Constitution (18) prescribed in Article 143, § 1, is all the more important in this matter as the federal powers regarding the enforcement of the public order (sanitary police), civil protection And civil security are so wide that they can, from Hunaard, have a major impact on domains that are the competence of other governments. A responsible exercise of these powers, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, assumes that the decision of the federal government is a careful, scientific insight -based, consideration between on the one hand expected results of the consideration in the fight against an epidemic emergency and other situation and other ones its reversal on the policy domain die belongs to the communities and the regions. It happens to the Council of State that the precursor dedics has the principle of proportionality in the doctrine of the limitation conditions of fundamental rights, mutatis mutandis, also here. The principle implies that `The government in the light of the nature of the facts on which it supports, of the seriousness of those facts and the circumstances of the case, must show that the measure she is considering taking a necessary, appropriate and proportionate measure : In that respect, it is particularly important to ensure that there is a satisfactory right and closely related between the circumstances and the circumstances of the case and the disruption of public order that one wants with the intended police measure on the other hand prevent demand rule (19) to be justified(20) A second condition is that the federal government, which intends to take a measure that has a direct impact on domains that belong to dematerial competence of the federal states, must consult with those other governments in advance (21). Such a consultation may not lead to a distance or transfer of power, it is indispensable the consequences of the measures taken for the policy areas that can be correctly estimated to estimate the competence of disgusting and the regions and thus form a correct picture of it then not proportional nature of the measures taken. Such a consultation must be a conditionalism to be fulfilled to be in accordance with the principle of proportionality. This obligation to contribute does not exclude the result that the federal government, in view of the interdependence of the powers, conducts the consultation in the consultation committee, established at the Articles 31 and 31/1 of the ordinary law of 9 August 1980 `to reform the institutions' and about the measures to be taken a consensus to be taken. It can, however, happen that, in urgent situations (22), this consultation cannot take place, because otherwise the effectiveness of the measures to be taken would be affected. If that is the case, the federal government must be able to justify why it is not possible to consult that consultation and then, it must start consultation as soon as circumstances allow it. Defederal government must finally be there , as a third condition, also to ensure that it is strictly limited to what can be integrated into it authorized today on sanitary police, civil protection of civil security and thereby does not proceed to purely the material powers of another government. It is not possible to take measures without a sanitary dimension in the context of combating a single epidemic emergency based on the powers of administrative police, civil protection/or civil security. This way the federal government can. Laying a mouth mask and a social distance requirement in schools and museums, insofar as that is a proportional and necessary measure (edge ​​number 33), and - in extreme circumstances - self -decisions to close it (23). However, it cannot, however, impose alternative regulations for education and for cultural experience, such as the obligation to offer distance education or to provide for an online museum offer, or vice versa-exclude them. After all, such measures cannot be considered as sanitary measures ".15. In the present case, the research of the three above requirements leads to the following comments:- The requirement of material reliability is apparent from the prospective draft decision that was preceded by an analysis of The recent scientific data (24);- What the requirement for consultation, this has been taken, since the file submitted to the Council of State, shows that a consultation was organized in the consultation committee on 14 April 2021- finally-- finally- appropriate relaxation measures provided for in the present draft, in the context of what can be qualified as sanitary measures.16. In particular with regard to the test and pilot projects from Article 8 of the draft, the question arises whether the federal government is authorized to do so in the context of its powers on civil security, civil protection and sanitary e Police.Kan are assumed that those test and pilot projects provide valuable information for the evaluation and any adjustment of the measures contained in the Ministerial Decree of 28 October 2020, but that does not mean, as the Council of State has yet explained in aforementioned advice 68,936/AV, that the federal government to the communities (and the regions) "alternative arrangements for education and for cultural experience [can] impose". (25) The aid of the design are probably aware of the possibility that that test - and pilot projects can be interwoven with powers of the communities and the regions, since Article 8 of the draft means "the competent ministers" (26) who also select those projects and help determine the protocol with a framework, calendar and step -step plan for the Organization of those test and pilot projects. In addition, reference is made to the agreement with "the decision of the consultation committee in the matter". ERIS also such "decision" in the designed Article 8, § 4, first paragraph, 4 °, of the Ministerial Decree (Article 2 of the draft)When asked what the legal scope of the latter "decision", the authorized representative replied: "This addition must ensure that the protocols are drawn up on the basis of the decisions made of the consultation committee of 5 February 2021 where the specific modalities for reopening the Contact professions explicitly explained and the consultation committee of 19 March 2021 and 14 April 2021 where the possibility of organizing pilot projects was discussed. "These" decisions "of the consultation committee have no binding legal value (27) and cannot result in the federal government hair As out for outlined powers, by organizing test and pilot projects for which the communities or the regions are competent. (28) It is possible that the federal government works on that organization, specifically from the point of view of its powers, among other things by for those test and pilot projects exemption from Granting measures contained in the ministerial decision of 28oktober 2020 and with the intention of evaluating and adjusting Diot measures based on the findings of those test and pilot projects. The Federal Government can also organize its own proof and pilot project organizing within its material powers. In the competence conformer pretetation, the designed provision can be used.c.c. Vormseists17. Since legal provisions that provide a legal basis for the present draft do not authorize the Minister for the Interior of the Interior to deviate from the mandatory preceding formal requirements, these must in any case be fulfilled.18. Since the legal provisions that do not require the legal land forms of the draft that that draft is determined on the basis of consultation within Deminister Council, follows from Article 6, § 1, of the law of 15 December 2013 `containing various provisions of administrative simplification 'that it is in principle is not obliged to perform an impact analysis in connection with this. And from Article 10 of the Royal Decree of 21 December 2013 'Conducting of Title 2, Chapter 2, of the Act of 15 December 2013 containing various provisions of administrative simplification' it follows that there is no reason to devote a member in the preamble Any ground for exemption from the obligation to perform an impact analysis. The member of the preamble must therefore be canceled. Investigation of the text alternative remark regarding the restriction of fundamental rights - proportionality/equality19. The Administrative Law of the Council of State ruled in its judgment no. 249.904 of 24 February 2021, NV Derby, the following: "Les Parties Requérantes Ne Contestent Pas Que L'Arrêté Ministériel Attaqué Poursuit Un Objectifde Santé Publique et qu'il S ' Agit là d'An Objectif Légitime.

La Partie Advertiser A Opté, Depuis Plusieurs Mois, Pour Une Réouverture Progressive Certains Sectors au Regard des Exigences Sanitaires et ÉconomiquesThe Minister of the Interior has a large power of discretionary appreciation to seek a balance between separate interests and often conflicting, in order to achieve a decision which serves the general interest and it does not belong to the Council of State to substitute His appreciation to that of the minister on the strategy to follow in the context of the management of a pandemic. (...) With regard to the principle of proportionality, it should be recalled that the attacked ministerial decree consecrates a new point of balance holding the evolution of the health situation and in particular the evolution of the number of infections, deshospitizations, the rate of positivity and the reproduction rate in order to continue to limit the propagationu virus and that if the attacked decree provides for some Progressive softenings, in particular for non -medical contact approaches or outdoor activities, it still imposes and maintains many other restrictions in order to reach this team free. All the measures provided for by the ministerial decree October 28, 2020, as modified in particular by the ministerial decree attacked, therefore form a toutindisible and inseparable and it is with regard to this set that proportionality is applied. The applicant parties do not dispute that the attacked ministerial decree pursued objective of public health and that this is a legitimate objective. If it is correct that the healthy health must be understood as much physical health and mental health, the preamble to the decree attacked that the opposing party has regarded, in the context of its appreciation of proportionality All of these measures, to the problem of mental health since it decides to gradually proceed with the reopening of non-medical contact professions whose services can precisely be made to the mental well-being of citizens. Contrary to what the applicant parties support, the opposing party therefore did not, during its appreciation, neglected the mental health of citizens ".

De Protocollen en Gidsen Kunnen Enkelverordenende Maatregelen, Zoals Bepaald in Het Verordenend.artikel29 van het huidige minister Besluit Bepaalt dat bepalingen van een protocol of gids die minder striktzijn dan de regels van het miniTerieel besluit buiten toepassing worden gelaten.

Bovendien Valt Niet in Te Zien Waarom Het Ontworpen Artikel 29, Eerste Lid, Van Het Ministryelbesluit Van 28 Oktober 2020 Bepalingen Van Protocollen (Of Gidsen) Buiten Toepassing Zou Moetenindian Deze toch niet abstract in Algemeen Verbinde Zouden Zijn. Vooral de Mogelijkheid in Het have haveworpenartikel 29, tweede lid, van het miniTerieel Besluit van 28 OKTOBER 2020 OM aan de hand protocollenaf te wijken van bepalingen uit het miniTerieel besluit voor proef- en pilootProjecten toont aan datert toch een verordenend waardenend uitgat van. Ook Elders Stelt of Gemachtigde Dat "Deeconomische Inspectie Controllet [..] for compliance with measures arising from the MB (and the cases of concrete measures arising from the sector protocols) ". It should finally be noted that the Article 8, § 4, first paragraph, 2 °, 3 ° and 4 °, in the designed Article 8, § 4, first paragraph, 2 °, 3 ° and 4 ° and second member, 2 ° (Article 2 of the draft) Certain exceptions to the prohibition on certain service performance are accompanied by a reference to "Compliance with the modalities foreseen in Het -Optor Protocol" and that the definition of the concept of "protocol" in Article 1, 3 °, of the Ministerile Decree of 28 October 2020 reports the "Rules to be applied" .20.3. Die ambivalence should be canceled. After all, one of the two of them: either the protocols have no order character but then the concretisations they are not binding, the protocols cannot differ from the ministerial decision, and compliance with it cannot be controlled and maintained by setting up a criminal claim for non-compliance with it; In other words, the protocols are orders are the measures that they are intangibly binding, but then these measures must be included in decisions of the competent government.

The minors of their own household or the people who need guidance may be accompanied by one adult. "23.1. Quite apart from any problems of evidence about those who maintain close contact as referred to in Article 15bis of the Ministerial Decree of 28oktober 2020, the relationship between the first and second phrases must be clarified. They too can only be accompanied by one adult of the same household or by an adult sustainable maintain contact, the second phrase is unnecessary. If the adult companion can be added to the companion of the same household or by sustainably maintained close contact, this must be defined in the dispositive of the designed determination.23.2. More generally, question arises as to how the relaxation for the design provided for in Article 1, 2 °, relates to other provisions of the Ministerial Decree to be changed. For example, Article 13, second paragraph, of that decision stipulates with regard to markets that "individual] is being done and for a period of a maximum of 30 minutes". The authorized representative stated the following: "This is a justified consideration. This discrepancy is unintentioned unintentionally We propose to add the following additional article to the design: Articlex.

'; 2 ° The third paragraph is replaced as follows: `A visitor may be accompanied by one person from the same household or by sustainable maintaining close contact referred to in Article 15bis.
