Art. 3, § 1 coordinated laws on the Council of State). The decision is immediately submitted for definitive approval. Motiveringdit Decree is based on the following motives:- The COVID-19 Pandemie is exponential and has a major impactop The academies of part-time art education, the CLBs, the Adult Education Centers, the Education Personsoneels. In order to continue the educational offer in safe circumstances and to guarantee the right to pay for students, a few urgent measures must be taken. In the context of the outbreak of COVID-19, the academies have incurred a lot of extra costs for the (re-rein ) Starting up for a safe school environment so that the students get lessons and give the teachers' lessons in a safe environment. Maximum (hand) hygiene is essential to prevent new outbreaks of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Furthermore, academy can invest in additional brushing of classrooms and studios, frequent cleaning of work tables, machines and shared instruments. Finally, the academy must invest in Plexi walls: reception desk, learning activities that cannot take place with mouth masks (such as playing an instrument). To reimburse the academies for these costs, additional operating resources are granted. In the framework of the exponential further expansion From the COVID-19 Virus, the CLBs have a lot of extras due to the contact examination and registering the infections among teachers and students in the data registration system LARS.- the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemie for compulsory also for the 2020-2021 school year to take additional measures. The changes relate to the allocation to the Centers for Basic Education and the Centers for Adult Education of additional operating resources to compensate for the costs incurred against the distribution of COVID-19.- In October 2020, the federal test strategy changed. Persons who have to preventive in seclusion from that moment (eg pending the results of their COVID test) must have 10 calendar days in quarantineConsequently, such staff members (if they cannot perform their work from home) could no longer be replaced due to insufficient time absent. Staff members who are older from a child whose school is closing or that must be in quarantine will then potentially get into trouble: the leave for force majeure is limited to 4 days. After all, the regular replacement scheme allows me from an absence of 10 working days. This is especially problematic for small schools. When a significant part of the teaching personnel has to stay at home, the organization is already becoming a quick point. In September and October, therefore, a few schools closed their doors for the sake of staff shortage, even after exhaustion of the teacher platform and the short replacements.
