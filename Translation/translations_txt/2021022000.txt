In particular, it initiates the so -called "variable reimbursements". After all, the 'warranty' aims to limit the fee of the ASO to the basic compensation (the total gross fee per month of 5,000Eur included in the calculation formula covers both the gross cost of the basic reimbursement and of the variable costs). In Article 10 of the Decree, Article 8 of the KB UFFT is amended to clarifying a different use is possible, to the extent that this meets the requirements included in the decisions on condition that the ASO and Haio have obtained their contractually lawful reimbursements.

If it had already been decided in the hospital to grant extra amounts in the context of COVID-19, the surplus with regard to the usual reimbursements may be settled on the envelope. A balance on this envelope must always be used for the benefit of the ASOEN Haio who worked in the hospital during the month concerned: either in the form of a specific compensation for an ASO or Haio to recognize a special deployment or by increasing of the monthly gross premium of all ASO and HAIO.- The allowances in Article 6, a) t.e.M.E) of the KB UFFT are extended to the second semester 2020.- This extension is made the allowances in e) dependent on the respect of the conditions set out to avoid amounts that are not used for the intended purpose. contrary to the distribution principles in the decision -receiving principles were paid by deducting them from the settlement ofh et subsequent semester.

The main additions relate to:- a temporal expansion naar The second semester 2020 of certain allowances (allowances with regard to the descending activity and the additional activities of care providers). There is also an end date for the additional cost charges and the availability faat, namely 30 September 2021;-a material expansion of the allowances by providing a contribution to the hospitals for 2020, taking into account the missed income from personal shares of patients and patients because of patients who are not connected via an insurance institution. For the independent care providers financed by Honoraria, there is a plan for the period in which the hospitals were in phase 2b of the 'Surge Capacity' plan. The incentive premium for the Doctors-Specialistin Training (ASO) and the General Practitioners-in-Training (HAIO) in Hospital Internship, in accordance with the premium for the hospital staff as provided for in Article 74undecies of the Royal Decree of 25 April2002 on determination and the Vere FFEEN OF THE BUCKET OF FINANCIAL REGULATIONS OF THE HOSPITALS.

These last two also apply to the Haio in Hospital Internship;- A number of control measures are being explicit, or, with regard to extensions to the second semester, more strongly anchored. Articles 1 and 9 provide an allowance for the months of October to December 2020 for the Independent care providers funded by fees who have carried out other activities within the hospital on his own initiative or at the request of the chief doctor as a result of the "Hopsital & Transportsurge Capacity" committee in this period. The design of this financing is to know an amount in proportion to the deployment shown. Article 2 describes which personnel costs are covered with allowances in the context of the KB UFFT.ikel 3 contains a few technical adjustments and records an end date for the flat -rate reimbursements at 30 September 2021. article4 contains technical corrections and in an expansion of the allowances:- Single-for-voorfaitary compensation is provided for the missed income of hospitals from invoicing the patient on the basis of the tariff regulation of health insurance. After all, these are the health insurance policy in the logicavan part of the reimbursement for the operating costs of the hospitals;-- an intervention is provided to cover the missed revenues for care to patients who are not affiliated with an insurance institution- the foreseen compensions are extended the second Semester 2020. If it appears that certain ASO and Haio that are borne by the hospital were not paid, these amounts can be deducted from the warranty on the payments of the following semester. Item 5 clarifies in which settlement items are included in Article 6 Various extensions and clarifications are included:-Based allowances are extended to the Haio who were eligible in hospital internships during the period of time--the term 'doctors' specialists' is replaced by' care provider-financed by Honoraria 'in view of the allowance for the benefit of all Zorgverle Ners financed Doorhonoraria involved in the activity. .- The reference to the allowance for the benefits guarantees is corrected;- the allowance included in Article 6, §3, e) of the KB UFFT is expandedRefined and split into three parts:- The first part still relates to basic reimbursement for the ASO. Here it is clarified that it will be the ASO that is charged to an independent doctor, to avoid a double financing. After all, some ASO are paid through the payments on the fees, in which it is met in Article 4, § 3, of the KB UFFT, and other ASO for their basic reimbursements are proceeds from a third party (Defense, Academic or Scientific Institution, financed via a fair ). The purpose of this allowance is primarily to guarantee the basic allowance. The applicant remains a residual balance, this must be used to comply with the other contractual obligations with regard to ASO and Haio, to the extent that they are charged to an independent doctor. In particular, it initiates the so -called "variable reimbursements". After all, the 'warranty' aims to limit the fee of the ASO to the basic compensation (the total gross fee per month of 5,000Eur included in the calculation formula covers both the gross cost of the basic reimbursement and of the variable costs). In Article 10 of the Decree, Article 8 of the KB UFFT is amended to clarifying a different use is possible, to the extent that this meets the requirements included in the decisions on condition that the ASO and Haio have obtained their contractually lawful reimbursements. This allegation thus aims to anchor the principle of a 'guarantee' clearer and avoid that this allowance is used to illuminate the 'usual costs' on the fee, without there being a proportional impact on the Honoraria income by the COVID-19 -Pidemie;-the second part must allow every ASO and Haio working in the hospital to provide a gross premium of 250 euros gross per month. If they worked in several hospitals, the payment is made in mutual agreement between these hospitals to ensure that this ASO will only receive the gross amount once paid per month. This is checked in this way on the basis of the reporting system of reporting. A third part consists of an envelope hospital level that, if necessary, finance a share of the variable reimbursements of the ASO and the extra facturations of the Haio financed could be. In addition to this use, which should be limited to the necessary, the design of this allowance for the ASO and Haio that have been used to reimburse an increase in their variable compensation for the ASO, or an additional allowance, regarding the Haio concerns. If it had already been decided in the hospital to grant extra amounts in the context of COVID-19, the surplus with regard to the usual reimbursements may be settled on the envelope. A balance on this envelope must always be used for the benefit of the ASOEN Haio who worked in the hospital during the month concerned: either in the form of a specific compensation for an ASO or Haio to recognize a special deployment or by increasing of the monthly gross premium of all ASO and HAIO.- The allowances in Article 6, a) t.e.M.E) of the KB UFFT are extended to the second semester 2020.- This extension is made the allowances in e) dependent on the respect of the conditions set out to avoid amounts that are not used for the intended purpose. contrary to the distribution principles in the decision -receiving principles were paid by deducting them from the settlement ofh et subsequent semester. provisions of Article 7 of the KB UFFT more clearly formulated and there is a limit in time by adding an end date. In Article 9 of the Decree, a new allowance is provided forNamely an "involvement of". This is awarded for the months of October to December 2020 on the basis of the number of reserved beds in phase 2b. This `envelope 'is intended to grant an amount to independent care providers funded Doorhonoraria in the hospital who voluntarily or commissioned by the main doctor The tasks that they usually perform were charged with other tasks. In Article 10 of the amendment decision, a number of clarifications and adjustments are provided:- The allocation of allowance to independent care providers funded by fees take into account the number of FTE of the independent care providers with regard to the total Number of FTE from healthcare providers funded by Honoraria. This initiates only a clarification of what was meant by the reference to 'share' and the relationship met the requested 'employment rate'-- for the award to the hospital of the permanence honoraria at the level of 2019, it will be charged with Detestion of independent doctors with regard to the FTE of all doctors. This adjustment takes into account that these fees can only be charged by doctors. This is an expansion of the allowance. However, the amount awarded is not reserved for the distribution by Demedic Council or to independent doctors. This amount is, as other amounts for independent care providers, divided between the medical council and the 'ad hoc' organ for other independent care providers financed by Honoraria, in other words between the independent doctors and the independent other care providers financed. After all, it is not an income guarantee, but an allowance for the benefit of both doctors and other healthcare providers funded by fees who took permanences involved COVID-19 period;- a distribution method is provided for the budgets for independent caregivers financed by Honoraria, namely between the Independent doctors and Deneere independent care providers funded by Honoraria. Since the budgets for salary providers financed by fees end up with one decision-making body, namely the hospital, this group does not provide an explicit split for this group. It is clarified that the calculations of the allowances for the ASO and Haio are also leaving from lists supplied by the hospital.-- The granting options to the individual care providers are clearly paid. A hospital that has a positive balance for a given semester, has a negative balance or negative provisional balances from previous semesters. This is to avoid that additional deposits are charged to the health insurance, while amounts are still being recovered. At the time of the final settlement, account is taken of all the last-optional information;- The provision on temporary unemployment is adjusted to approach correctly appropriate cost price of the employee concerned who was set at temporary unemployment. by clarifying on the first two conditions that there may be the intention to pass the costs related to the COVID-19 crisis to the patient. This is not the case if an increase in fee supplements or payments is the result of fixed investment decisions , where the COVID-19 Epidemia has no influence on the origin of the resources and there would have been an increase without the COVID-19 crisis. These terms and conditions with regard to the increases of fee supplements or payments continue to apply ZOLIZER. There are allowances. Article 13 of the Decree adds a new Article 10/1 to the KB UFTT in which it is explicit that the usual check by the file managers of the FPS VVVL and the Department of Medical Evaluation and Control of the RIZIV remains applicable. In view of the amounts of health insurance, amounts can be reclaimed in accordance with the Procedure of Procedure in the Mandatory Insurance Act for Medical Care and Benefits.ikel14 of the Decree provides an entry into force on 12 November 2020, in accordance with the entry into force of the KB UFFT that by the present Decision is being amended.

There is also an end date for the additional cost charges and the availability faat, namely 30 September 2021;-a material expansion of the allowances by providing a contribution to the hospitals for 2020, taking into account the missed income from personal shares of patients and patients because of patients who are not connected via an insurance institution. For the independent care providers financed by Honoraria, there is a plan for the period in which the hospitals were in phase 2b of the 'Surge Capacity' plan. The incentive premium for the Doctors-Specialistin Training (ASO) and the General Practitioners-in-Training (HAIO) in Hospital Internship, in accordance with the premium for the hospital staff as provided for in Article 74undecies of the Royal Decree of 25 April2002 on determination and the Vere FFEEN OF THE BUCKET OF FINANCIAL REGULATIONS OF THE HOSPITALS. The allowance for the ASO is split into three parts: the guarantee for the basic compensation, a monthly gross premium of EUR 250 and the distribution of a hospital -wide envelope. These last two also apply to the Haio in Hospital Internship;- A number of control measures are being explicit, or, with regard to extensions to the second semester, more strongly anchored. Articles 1 and 9 provide an allowance for the months of October to December 2020 for the Independent care providers funded by fees who have carried out other activities within the hospital on his own initiative or at the request of the chief doctor as a result of the "Hopsital & Transportsurge Capacity" committee in this period. The design of this financing is to know an amount in proportion to the deployment shown. Article 2 describes which personnel costs are covered with allowances in the context of the KB UFFT.ikel 3 contains a few technical adjustments and records an end date for the flat -rate reimbursements at 30 September 2021. article4 contains technical corrections and in an expansion of the allowances:- Single-for-voorfaitary compensation is provided for the missed income of hospitals from invoicing the patient on the basis of the tariff regulation of health insurance. After all, these are the health insurance policy in the logicavan part of the reimbursement for the operating costs of the hospitals;-- an intervention is provided to cover the missed revenues for care to patients who are not affiliated with an insurance institution- the foreseen compensions are extended the second Semester 2020. If it appears that certain ASO and Haio that are borne by the hospital were not paid, these amounts can be deducted from the warranty on the payments of the following semester. Item 5 clarifies in which settlement items are included in Article 6 Various extensions and clarifications are included:-Based allowances are extended to the Haio who were eligible in hospital internships during the period of time--the term 'doctors' specialists' is replaced by' care provider-financed by Honoraria 'in view of the allowance for the benefit of all Zorgverle Ners financed Doorhonoraria involved in the activity. .- The reference to the allowance for the benefits guarantees is corrected;- the allowance included in Article 6, §3, e) of the KB UFFT is expandedRefined and split into three parts:- The first part still relates to basic reimbursement for the ASO. Here it is clarified that it will be the ASO that is charged to an independent doctor, to avoid a double financing. After all, some ASO are paid through the payments on the fees, in which it is met in Article 4, § 3, of the KB UFFT, and other ASO for their basic reimbursements are proceeds from a third party (Defense, Academic or Scientific Institution, financed via a fair ). The purpose of this allowance is primarily to guarantee the basic allowance. The applicant remains a residual balance, this must be used to comply with the other contractual obligations with regard to ASO and Haio, to the extent that they are charged to an independent doctor. In particular, it initiates the so -called "variable reimbursements". After all, the 'warranty' aims to limit the fee of the ASO to the basic compensation (the total gross fee per month of 5,000Eur included in the calculation formula covers both the gross cost of the basic reimbursement and of the variable costs). In Article 10 of the Decree, Article 8 of the KB UFFT is amended to clarifying a different use is possible, to the extent that this meets the requirements included in the decisions on condition that the ASO and Haio have obtained their contractually lawful reimbursements. This allegation thus aims to anchor the principle of a 'guarantee' clearer and avoid that this allowance is used to illuminate the 'usual costs' on the fee, without there being a proportional impact on the Honoraria income by the COVID-19 -Pidemie;-the second part must allow every ASO and Haio working in the hospital to provide a gross premium of 250 euros gross per month. If they worked in several hospitals, the payment is made in mutual agreement between these hospitals to ensure that this ASO will only receive the gross amount once paid per month. This is checked in this way on the basis of the reporting system of reporting. A third part consists of an envelope hospital level that, if necessary, finance a share of the variable reimbursements of the ASO and the extra facturations of the Haio financed could be. In addition to this use, which should be limited to the necessary, the design of this allowance for the ASO and Haio that have been used to reimburse an increase in their variable compensation for the ASO, or an additional allowance, regarding the Haio concerns. If it had already been decided in the hospital to grant extra amounts in the context of COVID-19, the surplus with regard to the usual reimbursements may be settled on the envelope. A balance on this envelope must always be used for the benefit of the ASOEN Haio who worked in the hospital during the month concerned: either in the form of a specific compensation for an ASO or Haio to recognize a special deployment or by increasing of the monthly gross premium of all ASO and HAIO.- The allowances in Article 6, a) t.e.M.E) of the KB UFFT are extended to the second semester 2020.- This extension is made the allowances in e) dependent on the respect of the conditions set out to avoid amounts that are not used for the intended purpose. contrary to the distribution principles in the decision -receiving principles were paid by deducting them from the settlement ofh et subsequent semester. provisions of Article 7 of the KB UFFT more clearly formulated and there is a limit in time by adding an end date. In Article 9 of the Decree, a new allowance is provided forNamely an "involvement of". This is awarded for the months of October to December 2020 on the basis of the number of reserved beds in phase 2b. This `envelope 'is intended to grant an amount to independent care providers funded Doorhonoraria in the hospital who voluntarily or commissioned by the main doctor The tasks that they usually perform were charged with other tasks. In Article 10 of the amendment decision, a number of clarifications and adjustments are provided:- The allocation of allowance to independent care providers funded by fees take into account the number of FTE of the independent care providers with regard to the total Number of FTE from healthcare providers funded by Honoraria. This initiates only a clarification of what was meant by the reference to 'share' and the relationship met the requested 'employment rate'-- for the award to the hospital of the permanence honoraria at the level of 2019, it will be charged with Detestion of independent doctors with regard to the FTE of all doctors. This adjustment takes into account that these fees can only be charged by doctors. This is an expansion of the allowance. However, the amount awarded is not reserved for the distribution by Demedic Council or to independent doctors. This amount is, as other amounts for independent care providers, divided between the medical council and the 'ad hoc' organ for other independent care providers financed by Honoraria, in other words between the independent doctors and the independent other care providers financed. After all, it is not an income guarantee, but an allowance for the benefit of both doctors and other healthcare providers funded by fees who took permanences involved COVID-19 period;- a distribution method is provided for the budgets for independent caregivers financed by Honoraria, namely between the Independent doctors and Deneere independent care providers funded by Honoraria. Since the budgets for salary providers financed by fees end up with one decision-making body, namely the hospital, this group does not provide an explicit split for this group. It is clarified that the calculations of the allowances for the ASO and Haio are also leaving from lists supplied by the hospital.-- The granting options to the individual care providers are clearly paid. A hospital that has a positive balance for a given semester, has a negative balance or negative provisional balances from previous semesters. This is to avoid that additional deposits are charged to the health insurance, while amounts are still being recovered. At the time of the final settlement, account is taken of all the last-optional information;- The provision on temporary unemployment is adjusted to approach correctly appropriate cost price of the employee concerned who was set at temporary unemployment. by clarifying on the first two conditions that there may be the intention to pass the costs related to the COVID-19 crisis to the patient. This is not the case if an increase in fee supplements or payments is the result of fixed investment decisions , where the COVID-19 Epidemia has no influence on the origin of the resources and there would have been an increase without the COVID-19 crisis. These terms and conditions with regard to the increases of fee supplements or payments continue to apply ZOLIZER. There are allowances. Article 13 of the Decree adds a new Article 10/1 to the KB UFTT in which it is explicit that the usual check by the file managers of the FPS VVVL and the Department of Medical Evaluation and Control of the RIZIV remains applicable. In view of the amounts of health insurance, amounts can be reclaimed in accordance with the Procedure of Procedure in the Mandatory Insurance Act for Medical Care and Benefits.ikel14 of the Decree provides an entry into force on 12 November 2020, in accordance with the entry into force of the KB UFFT that by the present Decision is being amended.

The main additions relate to:- a temporal expansion naar The second semester 2020 of certain allowances (allowances with regard to the descending activity and the additional activities of care providers). There is also an end date for the additional cost charges and the availability faat, namely 30 September 2021;-a material expansion of the allowances by providing a contribution to the hospitals for 2020, taking into account the missed income from personal shares of patients and patients because of patients who are not connected via an insurance institution. For the independent care providers financed by Honoraria, there is a plan for the period in which the hospitals were in phase 2b of the 'Surge Capacity' plan. The incentive premium for the Doctors-Specialistin Training (ASO) and the General Practitioners-in-Training (HAIO) in Hospital Internship, in accordance with the premium for the hospital staff as provided for in Article 74undecies of the Royal Decree of 25 April2002 on determination and the Vere FFEEN OF THE BUCKET OF FINANCIAL REGULATIONS OF THE HOSPITALS. The allowance for the ASO is split into three parts: the guarantee for the basic compensation, a monthly gross premium of EUR 250 and the distribution of a hospital -wide envelope. These last two also apply to the Haio in Hospital Internship;- A number of control measures are being explicit, or, with regard to extensions to the second semester, more strongly anchored. Articles 1 and 9 provide an allowance for the months of October to December 2020 for the Independent care providers funded by fees who have carried out other activities within the hospital on his own initiative or at the request of the chief doctor as a result of the "Hopsital & Transportsurge Capacity" committee in this period. The design of this financing is to know an amount in proportion to the deployment shown. Article 2 describes which personnel costs are covered with allowances in the context of the KB UFFT.ikel 3 contains a few technical adjustments and records an end date for the flat -rate reimbursements at 30 September 2021. article4 contains technical corrections and in an expansion of the allowances:- Single-for-voorfaitary compensation is provided for the missed income of hospitals from invoicing the patient on the basis of the tariff regulation of health insurance. After all, these are the health insurance policy in the logicavan part of the reimbursement for the operating costs of the hospitals;-- an intervention is provided to cover the missed revenues for care to patients who are not affiliated with an insurance institution- the foreseen compensions are extended the second Semester 2020. If it appears that certain ASO and Haio that are borne by the hospital were not paid, these amounts can be deducted from the warranty on the payments of the following semester. Item 5 clarifies in which settlement items are included in Article 6 Various extensions and clarifications are included:-Based allowances are extended to the Haio who were eligible in hospital internships during the period of time--the term 'doctors' specialists' is replaced by' care provider-financed by Honoraria 'in view of the allowance for the benefit of all Zorgverle Ners financed Doorhonoraria involved in the activity. .- The reference to the allowance for the benefits guarantees is corrected- The allowance included in Article 6, §3, E) of the KB UFFT is expanded, refined and split into three parts:- The first part still relates to basic reimbursement for the ASO. Here it is clarified that it will be the ASO that is charged to an independent doctor, to avoid a double financing. After all, some ASO are paid through the payments on the fees, in which it is met in Article 4, § 3, of the KB UFFT, and other ASO for their basic reimbursements are proceeds from a third party (Defense, Academic or Scientific Institution, financed via a fair ). The purpose of this allowance is primarily to guarantee the basic allowance. The applicant remains a residual balance, this must be used to comply with the other contractual obligations with regard to ASO and Haio, to the extent that they are charged to an independent doctor. In particular, it initiates the so -called "variable reimbursements". After all, the 'warranty' aims to limit the fee of the ASO to the basic compensation (the total gross fee per month of 5,000Eur included in the calculation formula covers both the gross cost of the basic reimbursement and of the variable costs). In Article 10 of the Decree, Article 8 of the KB UFFT is amended to clarifying a different use is possible, to the extent that this meets the requirements included in the decisions on condition that the ASO and Haio have obtained their contractually lawful reimbursements. This allegation thus aims to anchor the principle of a 'guarantee' clearer and avoid that this allowance is used to illuminate the 'usual costs' on the fee, without there being a proportional impact on the Honoraria income by the COVID-19 -epidemic-The second part must allow every ASO and Haio working in the hospital to provide a gross premium of 250 euros gross per month. If they worked in several hospitals, the payment is made in mutual agreement between these hospitals to ensure that this ASO will only receive the gross amount once paid per month. This is checked in this way on the basis of the reporting system of reporting. A third part consists of an envelope hospital level that, if necessary, finance a share of the variable reimbursements of the ASO and the extra facturations of the Haio financed could be. In addition to this use, which should be limited to the necessary, the design of this allowance for the ASO and Haio that have been used to reimburse an increase in their variable compensation for the ASO, or an additional allowance, regarding the Haio concerns. If it had already been decided in the hospital to grant extra amounts in the context of COVID-19, the surplus with regard to the usual reimbursements may be settled on the envelope. A balance on this envelope must always be used for the benefit of the ASOEN Haio who worked in the hospital during the month concerned: either in the form of a specific compensation for an ASO or Haio to recognize a special deployment or by increasing of the monthly gross premium of all ASO and HAIO.- The allowances in Article 6, a) t.e.M.E) of the KB UFFT are extended to the second semester 2020.- This extension is made the allowances in e) dependent on the respect of the conditions set out to avoid amounts that are not used for the intended purpose. contrary to the distribution principles in the decision -receiving principles were paid by deducting them from the settlement ofh et subsequent semester. Provisions of Article 7 of the KB UFFT more clearly formulated and a limit in time is provided by adding an end date. In Article 9 of the Decree, a new allowance is provided for, namely an "involvement of involvement." This is awarded for the months of October to December 2020 on the basis of the number of reserved beds in phase 2b. This `envelope 'is intended to grant an amount to independent care providers funded Doorhonoraria in the hospital who voluntarily or commissioned by the main doctor The tasks that they usually perform were charged with other tasks. In Article 10 of the amendment decision, a number of clarifications and adjustments are provided:- The allocation of allowance to independent care providers funded by fees take into account the number of FTE of the independent care providers with regard to the total Number of FTE from healthcare providers funded by Honoraria. This initiates only a clarification of what was meant by the reference to 'share' and the relationship met the requested 'employment rate'-- for the award to the hospital of the permanence honoraria at the level of 2019, it will be charged with Detestion of independent doctors with regard to the FTE of all doctors. This adjustment takes into account that these fees can only be charged by doctors. This is an expansion of the allowance. However, the amount awarded is not reserved for the distribution by Demedic Council or to independent doctors. This amount is, as other amounts for independent care providers, divided between the medical council and the 'ad hoc' organ for other independent care providers financed by Honoraria, in other words between the independent doctors and the independent other care providers financed. After all, it is not an income guarantee, but an allowance for Voordelevan both doctors and other healthcare providers funded by fees who cared for permanences involved COVID-19 period- A distribution method is provided for the budgets for independent care providers funded by fees, namely between independent doctors and the Deandere care providers funded by fees. Since the budgets for salary providers financed by fees end up with one decision-making body, namely the hospital, this group does not provide an explicit split for this group. It is clarified that the calculations of the allowances for the ASO and Haio are also leaving from lists supplied by the hospital.-- The granting options to the individual care providers are clearly paid. A hospital that has a positive balance for a given semester, has a negative balance or negative provisional balances from previous semesters. This is to avoid that additional deposits are charged to the health insurance, while amounts are still being recovered. At the time of the final settlement, account is taken of all the last-optional information;- The provision on temporary unemployment is adjusted to approach correctly appropriate cost price of the employee concerned who was set at temporary unemployment. by clarifying on the first two conditions that there may be the intention to pass the costs related to the COVID-19 crisis to the patient. This is not the case if an increase in fee supplements or payments is the result of fixed investment decisions , where the COVID-19 Epidemia has no influence on the origin of the resources and there would have been an increase without the COVID-19 crisis. These terms and conditions with regard to the increases of fee supplements or payments continue to apply ZOLIZER. There are allowances. Article 13 of the Decree adds a new Article 10/1 to the KB UFTT in which it is explicit that the usual check by the file managers of the FPS VVVL and the Department of Medical Evaluation and Control of the RIZIV remains applicable.

The main additions relate to:- a temporal expansion naar The second semester 2020 of certain allowances (allowances with regard to the descending activity and the additional activities of care providers). There is also an end date for the additional cost charges and the availability faat, namely 30 September 2021;-a material expansion of the allowances by providing a contribution to the hospitals for 2020, taking into account the missed income from personal shares of patients and patients because of patients who are not connected via an insurance institution. For the independent care providers financed by Honoraria, there is a plan for the period in which the hospitals were in phase 2b of the 'Surge Capacity' plan. The incentive premium for the Doctors-Specialistin Training (ASO) and the General Practitioners-in-Training (HAIO) in Hospital Internship, in accordance with the premium for the hospital staff as provided for in Article 74undecies of the Royal Decree of 25 April2002 on determination and the Vere FFEEN OF THE BUCKET OF FINANCIAL REGULATIONS OF THE HOSPITALS. The allowance for the ASO is split into three parts: the guarantee for the basic compensation, a monthly gross premium of EUR 250 and the distribution of a hospital -wide envelope. These last two also apply to the Haio in Hospital Internship;- A number of control measures are being explicit, or, with regard to extensions to the second semester, more strongly anchored. Articles 1 and 9 provide an allowance for the months of October to December 2020 for the Independent care providers funded by fees who have carried out other activities within the hospital on his own initiative or at the request of the chief doctor as a result of the "Hopsital & Transportsurge Capacity" committee in this period. The design of this financing is to know an amount in proportion to the deployment shown. Article 2 describes which personnel costs are covered with allowances in the context of the KB UFFT.ikel 3 contains a few technical adjustments and records an end date for the flat -rate reimbursements at 30 September 2021. article4 contains technical corrections and in an expansion of the allowances:- Single-for-voorfaitary compensation is provided for the missed income of hospitals from invoicing the patient on the basis of the tariff regulation of health insurance. After all, these are the health insurance policy in the logicavan part of the reimbursement for the operating costs of the hospitals;-- an intervention is provided to cover the missed revenues for care to patients who are not affiliated with an insurance institution- the foreseen compensions are extended the second Semester 2020. If it appears that certain ASO and Haio that are borne by the hospital were not paid, these amounts can be deducted from the warranty on the payments of the following semester. Item 5 clarifies in which settlement items are included in Article 6 Various extensions and clarifications are included:-Based allowances are extended to the Haio who were eligible in hospital internships during the period of time--the term 'doctors' specialists' is replaced by' care provider-financed by Honoraria 'in view of the allowance for the benefit of all Zorgverle Ners financed Doorhonoraria involved in the activity. .- The reference to the allowance for the benefits guarantees is corrected;- the allowance included in Article 6, §3, e) of the KB UFFT is expandedRefined and split into three parts:- The first part still relates to basic reimbursement for the ASO. Here it is clarified that it will be the ASO that is charged to an independent doctor, to avoid a double financing. After all, some ASO are paid through the payments on the fees, in which it is met in Article 4, § 3, of the KB UFFT, and other ASO for their basic reimbursements are proceeds from a third party (Defense, Academic or Scientific Institution, financed via a fair ). The purpose of this allowance is primarily to guarantee the basic allowance. The applicant remains a residual balance, this must be used to comply with the other contractual obligations with regard to ASO and Haio, to the extent that they are charged to an independent doctor. In particular, it initiates the so -called "variable reimbursements". After all, the 'warranty' aims to limit the fee of the ASO to the basic compensation (the total gross fee per month of 5,000Eur included in the calculation formula covers both the gross cost of the basic reimbursement and of the variable costs). In Article 10 of the Decree, Article 8 of the KB UFFT is amended to clarifying a different use is possible, to the extent that this meets the requirements included in the decisions on condition that the ASO and Haio have obtained their contractually lawful reimbursements. This allegation thus aims to anchor the principle of a 'guarantee' clearer and avoid that this allowance is used to illuminate the 'usual costs' on the fee, without there being a proportional impact on the Honoraria income by the COVID-19 -Pidemie;-the second part must allow every ASO and Haio working in the hospital to provide a gross premium of 250 euros gross per month. If they worked in several hospitals, the payment is made in mutual agreement between these hospitals to ensure that this ASO will only receive the gross amount once paid per month. This is checked in this way on the basis of the reporting system of reporting. A third part consists of an envelope hospital level that, if necessary, finance a share of the variable reimbursements of the ASO and the extra facturations of the Haio financed could be. In addition to this use, which should be limited to the necessary, the design of this allowance for the ASO and Haio that have been used to reimburse an increase in their variable compensation for the ASO, or an additional allowance, regarding the Haio concerns. If it had already been decided in the hospital to grant extra amounts in the context of COVID-19, the surplus with regard to the usual reimbursements may be settled on the envelope. A balance on this envelope must always be used for the benefit of the ASOEN Haio who worked in the hospital during the month concerned: either in the form of a specific compensation for an ASO or Haio to recognize a special deployment or by increasing of the monthly gross premium of all ASO and HAIO.- The allowances in Article 6, a) t.e.M.E) of the KB UFFT are extended to the second semester 2020.- This extension is made the allowances in e) dependent on the respect of the conditions set out to avoid amounts that are not used for the intended purpose. contrary to the distribution principles in the decision -receiving principles were paid by deducting them from the settlement ofh et subsequent semester. provisions of Article 7 of the KB UFFT more clearly formulated and there is a limit in time by adding an end date. In Article 9 of the Decree, a new allowance is provided forNamely an "involvement of". This is awarded for the months of October to December 2020 on the basis of the number of reserved beds in phase 2b. This `envelope 'is intended to grant an amount to independent care providers funded Doorhonoraria in the hospital who voluntarily or commissioned by the main doctor The tasks that they usually perform were charged with other tasks. In Article 10 of the amendment decision, a number of clarifications and adjustments are provided:- The allocation of allowance to independent care providers funded by fees take into account the number of FTE of the independent care providers with regard to the total Number of FTE from healthcare providers funded by Honoraria. This initiates only a clarification of what was meant by the reference to 'share' and the relationship met the requested 'employment rate'-- for the award to the hospital of the permanence honoraria at the level of 2019, it will be charged with Detestion of independent doctors with regard to the FTE of all doctors. This adjustment takes into account that these fees can only be charged by doctors. This is an expansion of the allowance. However, the amount awarded is not reserved for the distribution by Demedic Council or to independent doctors. This amount is, as other amounts for independent care providers, divided between the medical council and the 'ad hoc' organ for other independent care providers financed by Honoraria, in other words between the independent doctors and the independent other care providers financed. After all, it is not an income guarantee, but an allowance for the benefit of both doctors and other healthcare providers funded by fees who took permanences involved COVID-19 period;- a distribution method is provided for the budgets for independent caregivers financed by Honoraria, namely between the Independent doctors and Deneere independent care providers funded by Honoraria. Since the budgets for salary providers financed by fees end up with one decision-making body, namely the hospital, this group does not provide an explicit split for this group. It is clarified that the calculations of the allowances for the ASO and Haio are also leaving from lists supplied by the hospital.-- The granting options to the individual care providers are clearly paid. A hospital that has a positive balance for a given semester, has a negative balance or negative provisional balances from previous semesters. This is to avoid that additional deposits are charged to the health insurance, while amounts are still being recovered. At the time of the final settlement, account is taken of all the last-optional information;- The provision on temporary unemployment is adjusted to approach correctly appropriate cost price of the employee concerned who was set at temporary unemployment. by clarifying on the first two conditions that there may be the intention to pass the costs related to the COVID-19 crisis to the patient. This is not the case if an increase in fee supplements or payments is the result of fixed investment decisions , where the COVID-19 Epidemia has no influence on the origin of the resources and there would have been an increase without the COVID-19 crisis. These terms and conditions with regard to the increases of fee supplements or payments continue to apply ZOLIZER. There are allowances. Article 13 of the Decree adds a new Article 10/1 to the KB UFTT in which it is explicit that the usual check by the file managers of the FPS VVVL and the Department of Medical Evaluation and Control of the RIZIV remains applicable. In view of the amounts of health insurance, amounts can be reclaimed in accordance with the Procedure of Procedure in the Mandatory Insurance Act for Medical Care and Benefits.ikel14 of the Decree provides an entry into force on 12 November 2020, in accordance with the entry into force of the KB UFFT that by the present Decision is being amended.

The main additions relate to:- a temporal expansion naar The second semester 2020 of certain allowances (allowances with regard to the descending activity and the additional activities of care providers). There is also an end date for the additional cost charges and the availability faat, namely 30 September 2021;-a material expansion of the allowances by providing a contribution to the hospitals for 2020, taking into account the missed income from personal shares of patients and patients because of patients who are not connected via an insurance institution. For the independent care providers financed by Honoraria, there is a plan for the period in which the hospitals were in phase 2b of the 'Surge Capacity' plan. The incentive premium for the Doctors-Specialistin Training (ASO) and the General Practitioners-in-Training (HAIO) in Hospital Internship, in accordance with the premium for the hospital staff as provided for in Article 74undecies of the Royal Decree of 25 April2002 on determination and the Vere FFEEN OF THE BUCKET OF FINANCIAL REGULATIONS OF THE HOSPITALS. The allowance for the ASO is split into three parts: the guarantee for the basic compensation, a monthly gross premium of EUR 250 and the distribution of a hospital -wide envelope. These last two also apply to the Haio in Hospital Internship;- A number of control measures are being explicit, or, with regard to extensions to the second semester, more strongly anchored. Articles 1 and 9 provide an allowance for the months of October to December 2020 for the Independent care providers funded by fees who have carried out other activities within the hospital on his own initiative or at the request of the chief doctor as a result of the "Hopsital & Transportsurge Capacity" committee in this period. The design of this financing is to know an amount in proportion to the deployment shown. Article 2 describes which personnel costs are covered with allowances in the context of the KB UFFT.ikel 3 contains a few technical adjustments and records an end date for the flat -rate reimbursements at 30 September 2021. article4 contains technical corrections and in an expansion of the allowances:- Single-for-voorfaitary compensation is provided for the missed income of hospitals from invoicing the patient on the basis of the tariff regulation of health insurance. After all, these are the health insurance policy in the logicavan part of the reimbursement for the operating costs of the hospitals;-- an intervention is provided to cover the missed revenues for care to patients who are not affiliated with an insurance institution- the foreseen compensions are extended the second Semester 2020. If it appears that certain ASO and Haio that are borne by the hospital were not paid, these amounts can be deducted from the warranty on the payments of the following semester. Item 5 clarifies in which settlement items are included in Article 6 Various extensions and clarifications are included:-Based allowances are extended to the Haio who were eligible in hospital internships during the period of time--the term 'doctors' specialists' is replaced by' care provider-financed by Honoraria 'in view of the allowance for the benefit of all Zorgverle Ners financed Doorhonoraria involved in the activity. .- The reference to the allowance for the benefits guarantees is corrected;- the allowance included in Article 6, §3, e) of the KB UFFT is expandedRefined and split into three parts:- The first part still relates to basic reimbursement for the ASO. Here it is clarified that it will be the ASO that is charged to an independent doctor, to avoid a double financing. After all, some ASO are paid through the payments on the fees, in which it is met in Article 4, § 3, of the KB UFFT, and other ASO for their basic reimbursements are proceeds from a third party (Defense, Academic or Scientific Institution, financed via a fair ). The purpose of this allowance is primarily to guarantee the basic allowance. The applicant remains a residual balance, this must be used to comply with the other contractual obligations with regard to ASO and Haio, to the extent that they are charged to an independent doctor. In particular, it initiates the so -called "variable reimbursements". After all, the 'warranty' aims to limit the fee of the ASO to the basic compensation (the total gross fee per month of 5,000Eur included in the calculation formula covers both the gross cost of the basic reimbursement and of the variable costs). In Article 10 of the Decree, Article 8 of the KB UFFT is amended to clarifying a different use is possible, to the extent that this meets the requirements included in the decisions on condition that the ASO and Haio have obtained their contractually lawful reimbursements. This allegation thus aims to anchor the principle of a 'guarantee' clearer and avoid that this allowance is used to illuminate the 'usual costs' on the fee, without there being a proportional impact on the Honoraria income by the COVID-19 -Pidemie;-the second part must allow every ASO and Haio working in the hospital to provide a gross premium of 250 euros gross per month. If they worked in several hospitals, the payment is made in mutual agreement between these hospitals to ensure that this ASO will only receive the gross amount once paid per month. This is checked in this way on the basis of the reporting system of reporting. A third part consists of an envelope hospital level that, if necessary, finance a share of the variable reimbursements of the ASO and the extra facturations of the Haio financed could be. In addition to this use, which should be limited to the necessary, the design of this allowance for the ASO and Haio that have been used to reimburse an increase in their variable compensation for the ASO, or an additional allowance, regarding the Haio concerns. If it had already been decided in the hospital to grant extra amounts in the context of COVID-19, the surplus with regard to the usual reimbursements may be settled on the envelope. A balance on this envelope must always be used for the benefit of the ASOEN Haio who worked in the hospital during the month concerned: either in the form of a specific compensation for an ASO or Haio to recognize a special deployment or by increasing of the monthly gross premium of all ASO and HAIO.- The allowances in Article 6, a) t.e.M.E) of the KB UFFT are extended to the second semester 2020.- This extension is made the allowances in e) dependent on the respect of the conditions set out to avoid amounts that are not used for the intended purpose. contrary to the distribution principles in the decision -receiving principles were paid by deducting them from the settlement ofh et subsequent semester. provisions of Article 7 of the KB UFFT more clearly formulated and there is a limit in time by adding an end date. In Article 9 of the Decree, a new allowance is provided forNamely an "involvement of". This is awarded for the months of October to December 2020 on the basis of the number of reserved beds in phase 2b. This `envelope 'is intended to grant an amount to independent care providers funded Doorhonoraria in the hospital who voluntarily or commissioned by the main doctor The tasks that they usually perform were charged with other tasks. In Article 10 of the amendment decision, a number of clarifications and adjustments are provided:- The allocation of allowance to independent care providers funded by fees take into account the number of FTE of the independent care providers with regard to the total Number of FTE from healthcare providers funded by Honoraria. This initiates only a clarification of what was meant by the reference to 'share' and the relationship met the requested 'employment rate'-- for the award to the hospital of the permanence honoraria at the level of 2019, it will be charged with Detestion of independent doctors with regard to the FTE of all doctors. This adjustment takes into account that these fees can only be charged by doctors. This is an expansion of the allowance. However, the amount awarded is not reserved for the distribution by Demedic Council or to independent doctors. This amount is, as other amounts for independent care providers, divided between the medical council and the 'ad hoc' organ for other independent care providers financed by Honoraria, in other words between the independent doctors and the independent other care providers financed. After all, it is not an income guarantee, but an allowance for the benefit of both doctors and other healthcare providers funded by fees who took permanences involved COVID-19 period;- a distribution method is provided for the budgets for independent caregivers financed by Honoraria, namely between the Independent doctors and Deneere independent care providers funded by Honoraria. Since the budgets for salary providers financed by fees end up with one decision-making body, namely the hospital, this group does not provide an explicit split for this group. It is clarified that the calculations of the allowances for the ASO and Haio are also leaving from lists supplied by the hospital.-- The granting options to the individual care providers are clearly paid. A hospital that has a positive balance for a given semester, has a negative balance or negative provisional balances from previous semesters. This is to avoid that additional deposits are charged to the health insurance, while amounts are still being recovered. At the time of the final settlement, account is taken of all the last-optional information;- The provision on temporary unemployment is adjusted to approach correctly appropriate cost price of the employee concerned who was set at temporary unemployment. by clarifying on the first two conditions that there may be the intention to pass the costs related to the COVID-19 crisis to the patient. This is not the case if an increase in fee supplements or payments is the result of fixed investment decisions , where the COVID-19 Epidemia has no influence on the origin of the resources and there would have been an increase without the COVID-19 crisis. These terms and conditions with regard to the increases of fee supplements or payments continue to apply ZOLIZER. There are allowances. Article 13 of the Decree adds a new Article 10/1 to the KB UFTT in which it is explicit that the usual check by the file managers of the FPS VVVL and the Department of Medical Evaluation and Control of the RIZIV remains applicable. In view of the amounts of health insurance, amounts can be reclaimed in accordance with the Procedure of Procedure in the Mandatory Insurance Act for Medical Care and Benefits.ikel14 of the Decree provides an entry into force on 12 November 2020, in accordance with the entry into force of the KB UFFT that by the present Decision is being amended.
