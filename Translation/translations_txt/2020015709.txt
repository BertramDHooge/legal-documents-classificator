"Vaccination of op -see flu - Winter season 2020-2021"; As described, an export ban is imposed for the Belgian packaging of three different types of flu vaccins; Having been put on advice 68.055/3 of the Council of State, given on 25 September 2020, with application of Article 84, § 1, first paragraph, 3 °, of the laws on the Council of State, coordinated on January 12, 1973; predominantly the vaccination against the seasonal flu 2020-2021 in the context of the COVID- 19 Pandemie is of interest and taking into account the limited availability of the vaccines, the FAGG has a taskforce -oriented with the various competent authorities and involved parties. This taskforce advised to let OMDIE vaccination of 2020-2021 continue in two phases. An approach that is supported by the ministers of public health (federal level and federated entities); that it is of crucial interest to vaccinate as many people who are at risk of complications to prevent overloading the health system and the occupancy rate in the hospitals as low as possible since there is a chance that the flu season coincides with a COVID-19 peak; that, in addition, the vaccination of people working in the health sector is important to not only protect patient indirect, but also to ensure their availability in the case of a new COVID-19Golf; that, finally, the vaccination of persons between 50 and 64 years old, it will allow work pressure to reduce first-line medicine; that all this results from the Advice No.9581 of the High Health Council (further "HGR") with regard to. "Vaccination against seasonal flu - winter season2020-2021", where the HGR is the importance of the flu vaccine Atie emphasizes: "This year, the HGRMEER wishes to recommend people from category A to be vaccinated in order to potentially reduce debts of hospital beds if the flu season would coincide immediately peak of COVID-19. It is also emphasized that vaccination of staff working in the health sector is of importance to not only protect patients indirectly but also to protect themselves and to guarantee those availability in the case of a new wave of COVID-19. In the same contextis, it is also desirable to also emphasize the vaccination of persons between 50 and 65 years against seasonal flu (category B). "That the importance of the public health of the vaccination fake is at least the priority groups lived by the HGR . The vaccination of the aforementioned risk groups is essential, in order to optimally prepare Belgian health care for the further course of the COVID-19 Pandemie; that the authorities concerned have issued an advice in that sense on 26 August 2020 regarding phased vaccination, with phased vaccination It was recommended, however, that it must be established that, in view of the explicit call from the HGR to vaccination of at least the risk groups and the estimate that one -grot group of people will proceed, there is a real chance that there will not be any time grooming vaccines available for the Belgian market for the Belgian market Both the aforementioned risk groups and the rest of the population supply; that Belgium will be able to stand out on 2.9 million vaccines against the seasonal flu, which is more than in recent years. This quantity will be sufficient to cover the vaccination of the target groups determined by the HGR, insofar as the vaccination percentage comparable is with the previous season and insofar as these vaccines do not flow to other countries - see here the aforementioned advice no. 9581 of the HGRThe HGR bases its advice on the Guidance document: Priority Risk Groups for Influenza Vaccination of the European Center for disease prevention (ECDC) tested against the position of the experts; that, public health, the expected higher vaccination rate (see Advice no. 9581 HGR, in which the HGR calls for this) and the limited number of available vaccines available, it should be avoided that the limited stock of vaccines would be carried out to other lecture state, in the context of parallel export; In the interest of public health, to keep the stock of vaccines intended for the Belgian market, to keep patients in Basic and therefore to prohibit their export; on the nomination of the Minister of Health, we have decided and we decide:: Article 1.
