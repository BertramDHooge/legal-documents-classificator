In addition to corrections, the time of approval in the form of an exemption from the payment of the vocational tax preliminary deduction applies to the application of the ordinance at which the second declaration on the preliminary vocational tax deduction (negative declaration on the preliminary vocational tax deduction) and the DE-minimis certificate in the administration are submitted. The amount of the exemption from the payment of the preliminary vocational tax deduction, which is requested in the second declaration for a certain declaration period, must also be noted in the certificate in reference to this period. In this way, the relevant debtor of the preliminary vocational tax tax is to be checked whether the DE-Minimis maximum amount is not exceeded by the requested exemption from the payment tax advance. The declaration of the advance payment of the professional tax must be submitted. In the FinProf system, it is not possible to attach the declaration on the preliminary vocational tax deduction of systems. In view of the limited number of debtors of the preliminary vocational tax deduction, which are considered for the measure, it did not seem appropriate to develop such an application. For this reason, it is proposed to send the FöD finance a scanned version of the completed, dated and signed certificate, more precisely to the e-mail address specified on the sample. In order to facilitate the processing this emails, in the subject of the e-mail "Certificate System Shipping" must be given, followed by the company number of the debtor of the vocational tax priority. the administration's certificate must be sent in a limited period of submission of the declaration to deduct the vocational tax. This deadline is determined on a maximum two working days after submitting the second declaration on the preliminary vocational tax deduction, in which the application of the exemption is requested from the payment of the vocational tax deduction. For a declaration of the administration of the administration in the second, July 16, 2019, for a declaration submitted on Friday, July 12, 2019. Professional tax deduction Application free of charge from the payment of the vocational tax rejection for system shipping is not granted. Since the rules in relation to thieving certificate cannot in principle be introduced retrospectively, this decree comes into force on the day of his publication in the Belgian State Gazette. This prevents debtors of the preliminary vocational tax rejected by using correct declarations to be able to apply for an exemption from the payment of the vocational tax preliminary deduction for system shipping for the remuneration, which they have paid or awarded before the 2019 entry into force and for which they have given the state treasury to the proceedings. The certificate must be sent to the administration by email at the latest on the second day after submitting the corriding explanations. It has no direct or indirect influence on the income and since no new application has to be developed for submitting the certificate, there are also no new expenses. be the vice -premier minister and minister of finance.

Set-requiring following form requirements are fulfilled:- The Vlaamseminister, competent for the budget, has given its agreement on 2 April 2020.- There is no advice Asked by the Council of State, with application of Article 3, § 1, of the laws on Deraad van State, coordinated on January 12, 1973. The urgent necessity does not allow you to wait on the advice of the Council of State within a short period From 5 days, because of the coronac crisis the very rapid evolution of the situation. It is of fundamental importance for their financial survivors that beneficiaries of a subsidy immediately get clarity about the costs that they can sign for activities that have not taken, limited or changed as a result of the civil emergency situation about the faster payment of promised advances. The Coronacrisis and the announcement by the Devlamic Government on 20 March of the duration of the civil emergency situation will result in the subsidization and recognition of socio-cultural adult work in the interest of the organizations and the Flemish work in the case of the Decree of 7 July 2017 Government Maximum Legal Certainty must be insured in current procedures. The period for concluding the agreed framework for investigation, which was laid down on 31 March 2020, has become unfeasible by the civil emergency situation and must be adjusted immediately. In Article 5 of a civil emergency situation with regard to public health, the Flemish government grants the authority the power to work out further rules for the suspension, stripping or extension of procedural periods or the temporary adaptation of procedural or procedural or the temporary or the temporary or the administration obligations in various decrees and the implementing decisions in addition to maximum legal certainty;- It is only fair to the costs that beneficiaries of a subsidy have incurred culture for activities that are not, or only limited or changed as a result The civil emergency situation under the Coronavirus COVID-19, to be paid out the limits of the granted subsidy. For example, it is avoided that for many beneficiaries of a subsidy dramatic financial problems arise. These are payments that are already foreseen and generate additional costs for the Flemish government .- For the already awarded operating subsidies2020, an advance of 50% or lower of the subsidy is usually paid. An advance payment has been made in the regulations dependent on a period of the granting government. The Department CJM can reorganize itself to pay additional advances that are provided for later in the financial year. The government can e.g. Create a parallel with project -based subsidies, where an advance of 80% or 90% is common, and the advance payment of July forward.

There can no longer be a visitor site organized at the regional organizations because of the risk of infection. Parallel to the assessment procedure for regional organizations, the administration must also be the commissions for the assessment procedure for organizations with an operation for Flanders (whether or not Including brussels). There, too, the coronacrisis causes problems in the field of organizational committees. In order for the current assessment round for these organizations to be at the best possible manner, it is decided to relocate the procedure for the regional organizations in part. It has been designated to get the assessment procedure for the Regional Organizations that not yet visited one year set. For the decision by the Flemish government on the new policy period, the regional organizations that did not yet receive a visitor this year are dealt with in the same way as the organizations that received positive adviceThe organizations with an effect within a specific region are assessed as follows (see the articles38, 42 to 44 of the Decree of 7 July 2017): In the first quarter of the last year of a policy period, the assessment committee will make a visit on the spot. The visit results in a report where the organizations get the following end result: positive, positive with recommendations of Negative with recommendations. Only a negative end result can have an impact on the level of the envelope. A remediation process follows a negative assessment. If this confirms the negative result, the Flemish government can decide to stop the subsidy. Since the Flemish government must subsidize one organization per region, a new organization will then have to be established in that provisional region. Currently, 7 of the 13 regional organizations have already been visited. One of them is negative, two are positive with recommendations and four are a positive. 6 regional organizations have not yet been visited. The proposal is to have the visits on the position of these 6 regional organizations take place in the first quarter of 2021.voorde 7 regional organizations that have already been visited, it is opted to provide the organization to the organization at least 15 July 22, § 2, 1 ° of the Decree of 7 July 2017 on the subsidization and recognition of the socio-cultural adult work is the quality of the functioning of the socio-cultural adult organizations that are not recognized at the time of the decree of 4 April 2003, among other things, assessed by the assessment committee the hand of an interview with the organization.

JambonPublication: 2020-04-22Numac: 2020030639federal Public Health Service, Safety of the Food Chain and Leefmilieu19 April 2020.-Royal Decree no. 10 for the granting and rules for the distribution and liquidation of an advance to the general hospitals in the context of The epidemic by the Coronavirus COVID-19 Report on the Koningsire, the three designs of decision that I am honored to submit to Your Majesty for signing, are the first step in support that is offered to the hospitals in the fight against the Coronavirus epidemic Covid- 19 That Belgium meets. Deal hospitals and the care providers in hospitals are confronted with different costs or a decrease in income compared to their normal operation. These are costs related to the implementation of the emergency plans that have a large, unforeseen impact on the normal activity, for additional costs for material, personnel, changes to the structure, etc., as well as loss of income (fees, fixed ones. .) Due to the cancellation of planned interventions, both for the patient who have been admitted to the hospital and for the outpatient patients. The financial resources of which the hospitals generally have, are not sufficient, in particular with regard to thesaurie, for those exceptional costs together with a decrease in the decrease in the income, to offer the head (large purchases, payment of staff, coverage of loss of activity, in particular for doctors and other healthcare providers, and the requirements of the suppliers to make the full payment in an order). legal and regulatory mechanism are put into effect to free up the financial resources so that a thesauriev quickly Oorschot to the general hospitals can be referred to for the time being to determine the rules for the distribution of that advance on the hospitals. The following phase will be determined the provisional rules for the distribution of that advance at the "fees" at the destination of the care providers, Including the Candidate-Artsen specialist of the hospital manager via the retrocessions that are usually agreed in each hospital, the other items at the expense of the hospital. A regularization of the awarded advance will then be proceeded to a regularization of the awarded. The aim is to make a comparison possible between the provisional budgets, as an advance, and the acceptable actual financial repair (costs and lower income). It will be ensured that at the regulararies account is kept with all the budgets granted and that there is no double financing. A working group from the Federal Hospital Facilities Council will give advice on the rules in case regularization of the posts charged to the hospital, which is possible say covered by the budget of final resources of the hospitals or by any other financing that belongs to the authority of the RIZIV, and on the measures that must be taken in the short and medium term in the framework of the same budget. A working group ad hoc, composed of Representatives of the Hospital Federations, representatives of the doctors' syndicates, specialists in hospitals, from the National Committee Doctors - Health Insurance Funds and Representatives of the Insurance Institutions, has the task of giving advice on the rules on regularization, as well as the measures that Mo have for a short and medium -term term food is taken in the context of the sectors that belong to the competence of the RIZIV. It should be noted that that first phase for the allocation of a billion euros exists in a budget transfer within the insurance for medical care. Depending on the evolution of the evolution situation and of the analyzes of the real needs that will be conducted, an additional budget could be requested in a second phase, on top of the current budget for medical care, so that the normal activities from the initial partial objectives will be taken from the amounts to be transferred , don't be compromised. In view of the exceptional nature of the dowers that it will cover in the context of public health, that increase in the current budget for medical care should partly be charged the government and not exclusively by the global management of social security. will serve to cover a period that is not yet certain during which the consequences of the Epidemienog can be felt. It is possible that the direct-financing operation operation may be repeated from the evolution of the crisisIt should also be noted that the situation for the psychiatric engineering hospitals will be analyzed and that ad hoc measures can be taken if necessary. The work groups will also evaluate the measures that can be taken on the basis of Article 101 of the capordinated Act on Hospitals and other care facilities ; In that article it is determined that the budget of the financial resources of the hospitals can fix the costs for the services as a result of an epidemic or a pandemic that is established by the King Bij Decides in the Council of Ministers, after advice from the High Health Council . In addition to the described thesaurie problems, all hospitals, including psychiatric hospitals, could be confronted with additional costs. According to the current formulation of the above -mentioned article 101, only costs that are not covered by the budget of the hospitals of the hospitals and those do not give rise to an allowance as referred to in the Coordinated Act of 14 July 1994 on mandatory insurance for medical care and benefits or its implementing decisions. In the current situation, the costs that are covered by the budget of the financial resources of the hospitals and that give rise to an allowance, however, high that the allowances are absolutely not sufficient to cover their expansion to the amount of COVID-13. That article must therefore be adjusted so that the costs that are normally charged but that are much higher than in a normal period can be charged by the budget of the financial resources of the hospitals. That possibility depends on the king, the king, Decree in the Council of Ministers and after advice from the High Health Council, of a state of epidemic or pandemie. The designs that are submitted to you give you the opportunity to take all necessary legal and regulatory measures so that that advance can be short -term on the one hand deposited and on the other hand any other costs in the context of the Governive Budget of the financial resources of the hospitals can be taken into account. Two decisions find their legal basis in Article 5, § 1, 2 °, 3 ° and 5 ° of the Act of Act March 27, 2020 that authorization grants the king to take measures in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19 (II), to safeguard the necessary reception capacity (2 °), to provide direct support to the non-profit sector (3 °) and to implement adjustments to social security law (5 °). In the first draft Royal Decree is provided for in the allocation of and deregels for the breakdown and liquidation of an advance to the general hospitals in the Boervan de Coronavirus epidemic COVID-19. Article 1 stipulates that an amount of 1 billion euros is released in the existing budgets so that the continuity of The hospital activity in the general hospitals in the financial level can be insured. In Article 2, all intention of hospital activities are defined. In Article 3, the distribution key for the provisional schedule of the advance on the general hospitals is defined. to carry the amount calculated by the Rizivwordt, on the bank account of each algae EMEEN HOSPITAL. In Article 5, it is explained that the released budget results from a redistribution by the minister competent for social cases, in the partial budget objectives of medical care, in compliance with the global budget objective of the medical care that has already been set before 2020. Met it Second draft Royal Decree a change is made of Article 101 of the Coordinated Act of 10 July 2008 at the hospitals and other care institutions. In Article 1, the concept of 'fixed' coverage of the costs is deleted so that account can be taken of real estate costs that, based on the basis Of the advice of the working groups, it will be 'accepted' in the special circumstances that can be attributed to the sanitary approach to the epidemic. In the same article it is also possible that the costs may not already be covered by a government system. The Draft draft Royal Decree is the necessary condition for the application of the aforementioned item 101, in particular the adoption, in the Council of Ministers and NA after Advice from the High Health Council, of a state of epidemic in Belgium. I have the honor to be, Sire, Vanuwe Majesty, the very respectful and very faithful servant, the Minister of Social Sea and Public Health, m. The Blockraad of State Department Legislation Advice 67210/3 of 14 April 2020 on a draft Royal Decree `For the removal of and the rules for the distribution and settlement of an advance to the General Hospitals in the framework of the epidemic by the Coronavirus COVID-19'On on April 6, 2020, the Council of State, Legislation Department, by the Minister of Social Affairs and Public Health, and of Asylum and Migration requested to provide an advice on a period of five working days on a draft of Royal Decree 'for the granting and the rules for distribution and settlement of an advance of the general healthcare huonshuizen in the context of the epidemic by the Coronavirus Covid-19'. The design was investigated by the Third Chamber on April 9, 2020. The Chamber was composed of Jo Baert, Chamber President, Jeroenvan Nieuwenhove and Koen Muylle, state councils, state councils, Jan Velaers and Bruno Peeters, assessors, and Astrid Truyens, clerk. The report was published by Tim Corthaut, auditor. Erlandse text of the advice was checked under the supervision of Jeroen van Nieuwenhove, State Council. The advice, the text of which follows below, was given on April 14, 2020.1. 2020 `That authorization grants the king to take measures in the fight against the spread of the coronaviruscovid-19 (i) ', which refer to Article 84, § 1, first paragraph, 3 °, of the laws on the council of State , coordinated on January 12, 1973, the Legislation Division had to limit itself to the investigation of the legal basis of the draft, the competence of the author of the action and the Dee Fulfilling prior formal requirements. What those three points concerns, the draft gives the following comments . Speaking of the design2. The design of the Royal Decree submitted for advice is intended to distribute an amount of a billion euros over the GENEREENCHUINHOUSHUIZEN1 as "intervention in the indictment of the impact of the Epidemie Covid-19". That amount, which is released by a "redistribution (.. In the partial budget objectives of medical care ", in the form of advances over the general hospitals are deposited to the hospitals as quickly as possible. Article 1 of the draft stipulates that an amount of a billion euros is being released" so that the continuity of the Hospital activity in the general health careers on financial level can be assured by an intervention in the indictment of the COVID-19 Epidemia epidemic. Article 2 describes which hospital activity is intended, namely "all activities of the hospital and the care providers in the hospital, in particular in the common services, the classic hospitalization, day hospitalization, the technical platforms, the ambulatory activities and the" RIZIV agreements "" "" . Article 3 stipulates that the aforementioned amount provides for the time being "on the basis of the part of each general hospital in relation to the total RIZIV expenditure of the general hospitals for the whole of the activities, as defined in Article 2, based on the RIZIV documents P, supplemented with the variable part of his budget of financial resources, the fixed day hospitals as well as the medicines for the full year 2018 ". Article 4 concerns the administrative handling of the deposit of the advances by the RIZIV. Article 5 Instructed Minister for Social Affairs to release the amount referred to in Article 1 "by redistribution (...) in the partial budget objectives of medical care, in compliance with the global budget objective that has already been set before 2020". Taking a decision takes effect on the date of publication thereof in the Belgian Official Gazette (Article 6) .3. The design of the Landtenam with two other designs of Royal Decree that are simultaneously submitted for advice on the Council of State, whereby on the one hand Article 101 of the coordinated law of 10 July 2008 `At the hospitals and other care facilities' (hereinafter: the Hospital Act) is activated by the Adoption of the existence of a COVID-19 epidemic in Belgium, 2 and on the other hand that provision itself is changed to expand the size of the eligible costs.3 The coherence explained the coherence between these designs as follows: "Les Hôpitaux Doiventfaire Face d'Une part à des surcoûts (par Exemple: Heures Supplémentaires du Personnel, Coûts du Matériel, des Vêtements de Travail, Extension des Services de Soins Intensifs, ...) et d'Autre part, l'Activationdes plans d'Urgence impose une baisse des activités non urgentHowever, the main sources of funding for general hospitals are for approximately 40 % in connection with the budget for the financial means of hospitals (BMF), but also in a similar proportion in connection with the fees of care providers (doctors, paramedics, .. .) And fees supplements via retrocession mechanisms, etenfin inami packages (day hospital, clinical biology, medical imaging, ...), pertrose specialties and patient share. . Article101 therefore also implies that the notion of epidemic or pandemic be activated: this is the first link these orders. The modification of article 101 is essential because as if initially written, this article would not have made it possible to cover the additional costs encountered: thus, the intensive care services are laid down by the BMF ... without modification of the article, The additional costs in these services could not be taken care of. However, the crisis precisely implies a significant extension of the capacity of reception intensive care at the request of the authorities. The concept of lump sum coverage 'provided for in article 101 also appeared to be limiting' because currently a working group of the federal council of hospital establishments is busy working to establish the elements that will be covered more than what is covered during normal periods of hospital activities. Nothing allows, at this stage, to conclude with certainty that the most adequate covers will be packages (although the ideen is not to cover at real cost either because it would imply too high administrative charges, as for hospitals only for administrations). The proposed modification makes it possible to be able to cover costs which will be the subject of a royal decree as provided for in article 74septies of the decteroyal of April 25, 2002 relating to the fixing and liquidation of the budget for the Deshôpitale financial means. If the mechanism provided for in article 101 has the merit of existing, it has not been used until the framework of an epidemic/pandemic. In addition, this mechanism implies that the coverage of additional costs can only intervene within the framework of the calculation of an upcoming BMF (after objectification etcalculcul of these additional costs): concretely, this will therefore concern exercise 2021. However, hospitals must face currently To major cash problems: in fact, they must assume the usual costs (financing of their staff, equipment, infrastructure, etc.), additional costs (more full volume and higher prices, purchase purchase Other types of equipment, etc ...) and at the same time, apart from the fixed part of the BMF which is acquired from them, their revenues are greatly reduced since their essential activities had to be stopped. And therefore, the third Order allows you to give a short term response to this cash problem by liquidating directly (and not spread out in twelfth like for the BMF), an amount by hospital allowing it, in particular, to be able to pay your person to understand in the broad sense, it is -Ades including care providers. This system allows for rapid and direct hospitals because it is distinct from the usual financing system for hospitals by insurer organizations and the retroced fees of care providers. Indicated in the report to the King, this is a first step: the 'Order concerning the advance does not set the amount, the current budget from which it comes, the distribution key between hospitals and [the] liquidation methods (directly on a hospital account). A new decree is in preparation, in consultation with the actors concerned (doctors, hospitals, insurer organizations) to fix the distribution methods of the hospital in order to determine what this advance covers, and the methods of regularization also also be defined. In addition, according to the evolution of the crisis and the time of this one, it is not excluded to have to take a additional measure for a new advance. In the end, a decree makes it possible to respond to the acute treasury problem, A second makes it possible to guarantee laprise in charge of additional costs and the third makes it possible to trigger the second (epidemic). "Rechtsgrond4.Het haveworpen Besluit Vindt Rechtsgrond in Het Erste Lid Van de Aanhef Vermeldel Artikel 5, §1, 2 °, 3 ° In 5 °, Van de Wet van 27 maart 2020 `Die Machtiging Verleent aan de Koning Om Maatregelente Nemement in Stijd Tegen de Verspreiding van Het Coronavirus COVVI-19 (II) 'Based on that provision can the King, in order to make Belgium possible to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic or Pandemies, to take on the consequences of taking measures to indemnify the necessary logistics and reception capacity, including supply security or in addition to providing it (2 °), providing direct or indirect support for or taking protective measures for the affected financial sectors, the economic sectors, the profit and non-profit sector, the companies and households to limit the consequences of the pandemic ( 3 °) and make adjustments to labor law and social security law, with a view to the protection of employees and the population, the good organization of the companies the government, with a safeguarding of the economic interests of the country and the continuity of the Criticism (5 °). The decisions contained the aforementioned measures may also eliminate, supplement, change or replace the applicable legal provisions in accordance with Article 5, §2, of that Act, even in containing the Constitution of the Constitution to the Preservation of the Act. As a state aid measure within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Convention on the Function of the European Union (hereinafter: TFEU), can be qualified. In the framework for the current crisis, the European Commission uses a 'temporary framework regulation on state aid support of the Economy because of the current COVID -19 outbreak ', 4 in which Zezich essentially engages a faster and - on a number of points - smoother assessment of the compatibility of state aid measures with the internal market. However, this communication from the Commission does not take away that state aid schemes still need to register on the basis of Article 108 (3) of Hetvweu, unless an exemption scheme can be made. The announcement does not change that. The question of whether the designed scheme was already registered, Dogstemmijde replied as follows: "Non Pas à Ce Stade. Le Milliard Distribué Entre Les Hôpitaux Est UNERALOCATION THE LIGNES BUDGETAIRES SUR Lesquelles on Sait Déjà Y Aura Moins de Dépensesen 2020, ex: speechopédie, ergothérapie, kinésithérapie. "5.2. The designed regulation can be seen as a compensation for performance in the context of open -up service obligations, but clearly the conditions for not considering that compensation is not met as state aid.5 The designed scheme does not offer any transparency about the coordination between the financial resources that on The general hospitals are made available and the objective, so that overcompensation is possible. It must therefore also be registered with the committee.5.3. Force article 108, paragraph 3, third sentence, of the TFEU, a Member State cannot implement the intended measures before the Commission has made a final decision. In its Commission, the Commission states "to carry care for a quick decision -making after clear and complete registration of measures that include this notification. Member States must inform the Commission of their intention to introduce such measures as quickly and completely as possible. "6ER can therefore be expected an early assessment by the committee regarding the compatibility of the Support measures with the internal market. Held on to this and in view of the Draconian sanction die threatens in the event of an unjustified non-registration, it is recommended to report the designed regulation as soon as possible on the basis of Article 108 (3) of the TFEU. A provisional advances scheme 6.1. The design provides for a provisional and speedy distribution of an amount of a billion euros on general hospitals. In Article 3 of the design is mentioned from an "advance", so that the question arises as to what the precise nature of the designed scheme and whether a settlement of the advances will follow. The representative stated that the following: "L'Avance permet d'Assurer la viabilité et le phonctionalement des hôpitaux pendantla crise. Le montant correspond aux dépenses inami pour ces hôpitaux de l'Antité QUIK eaffet Hôpital Pour Tous Les Patients (Et à Fortiori Non Covid, Puisqu'Iln'y and Avait Pas and 2018). L'Important Est d'Assurer que tout le personnel qui travaille Puisse êtrePayé et assurer que l'ôpital Puisse Pour faire face à ses charges. C'est doncl'ensemble de l'Activité de l'hôpital qui est couverte et assurée. des Règes plus précises seron édictéesdans un arrêté and prety la régularation àla régularation àla régularation àla régularation àla régularation àla régularation àla régularation àla régularance Warranty 'Sera OctroyéeIt is because it is urgent to be able to liquidate the advance that the file of the first phase has already been introduced: indeed the hospitals will be confronted with the Plein whip from April and May with the impact of the crisis since It is at this point that they will only receive the amounts of recipes related to the activity of March and April (therefore impact on the fees, the inami packages and the variable part of the BMF). The advance must therefore be liquidated for April 15 to be able to ensure the continuity of services for the entire hospital. (...) [L] EBMF represents only around 40 % of funding revenues From the hospital and again, the hospital receives in the form of a twelfth only the fixed part. The advance therefore makes it possible to cover in cash with a speaking of other recipes. At the time of the regularization of this advance, the differential between the perceived amount and the amount `Prierity 'compared to the acceptable additional costs may be liquidated in the BMF (probably from July 2021). The advance is based on INAMI 2018 expenditure and therefore only holds what would represent the sources of revenue for the hospital other than the fixed part BMF: it is therefore in particular the variable part of the BMF, but also Expenses related to fees on care providers, day hospital, etc ... It is not the overall budget for hospitals, but the general objective of health care.

Het doel is om een ​​vergelijking mogelijkte maken tussen de voorlopig ontvangen budgetten, als voorschot, en de aanvaardbare werkelijke financiëleweerslag (kosten en lagere inkomsten).

The 2 working groups work intensively in order to be able to inform, parscular, as quickly as possible the hospitals of the principles which will be integrated into the projects made for the BMF part and the inami part. (...) two GT (from the CFEH and the GT ADHOCDE L'I INAMI with representatives of care providers) are busy developing the modalities; these will then be integrated into AR (AR BMF and ARA specific with regard to sources of financing `INAMI 'as the fees). However, it should be noted that the advance is not an amount for a single month. It is based on a concerted key with the actors, which is the closest to the reality of the costs of each general hospitalsLa régulararization aura pour objectif de s'assurerque les coûts, surcoûts et interventions dance les baisses de recettes qui auront été déterminés commissionables and vue de guaranteeir la viabilité et ltinuité seron's par l'Alentts turns out that COUTTERTS turns out that Couversts The designed regulation wants to align the immediate financial needs of the general hospital, since those hospitals are confronted with additional expenditure on the entrance of the COVID-19 epidemic and at the same time they have less income due to the postponement of a number of recordings and benefits. The Council of State is by no means disputed by no means the need for such a feeding arrangement, but it must nevertheless point out that a follow -up to this scheme is not only necessary, but must also be formalized as quickly as possible, even if the lines of the settlement were already communicated to the hospitals via a circular. The meet the immediate cash flowp After all, roses of the general hospitals do not alter the fact that there is uncertainty about the question of which expenses that hospitals will ultimately, after the settlement and its integration in the financing schemes of the budget of financial resources and of the disease and invalidity insurance, will see and in which Mate.the designed activation of article 101 of the Hospital Act (see design 67,212/3) To provide for a financing of the cost of the COVID-19 epidemic, that uncertainty does not take away, since that financing is only integrated in the budget of financial resources of 2021 and the conditions and its size are not yet known.b. The distribution of the advances 7.1. The amount of a billioneuro is not distributed over general hospitals on the basis of a criterion that is specifically related to the COVID-19 epidemic (such as the number of COVID-19 patients treated to a specific date), but in accordance with Article 3 of the design "Based on the part of each Algemeen Hospital in relation to the total RIZIV expenditure of the general hospitals for the whole of the activities, as defined in Article 2, based on the RIZIV Documents P, supplemented Methet Variable part of his Budget of financial resources, the fixed day hospitals as well as the medicines for the full year 2018 ". About the compatibility of that criterion with the principle of equality declared the following: "Suite aux premières réunions des groupes de travail, le secturhospitalier a demandé à ce que la clé de répartition soit la plus proche daestorme de ce qu'ptit C'est donc Cela qui a été prévu and utilisant tous les honoraires médicaux, dentaires, leaflets pharmaceutiques, soins de kiné, implants et dispositifs médicaux ains llie élébemfedu bmebledus bmebledus bmebledus bmebledus bmbledus bmebledus bmebledus bmebledus bmebledus bmebledus bmebledus bmebledus bmebledus bmebledus bmbledus bmbledus bmbledus bmbledus bmbledus bmbledus bmbledus bmbledus bmbledus Éiabledus Éiabledus Éiabledus Éiabledu's bmbledu.

Insofar as the advance arrangement tertoe is intended to alleviate the immediate financial needs of the general hospitals that do not only involve the additional expenses following the COVID-19 epidemic, but also with the Minderinsteoor the postponement of a number of recordings and benefits, with This view is agreed. However, the fact that the distribution key used does not say anything about the final settlement and integration thereof in the financing schemes of the budget of financial resources and of this factor and disability insurance, so that a general hospital that now receives a broad-in-advance dan Hospital, until the conclusion could be made that a reverse situation arises during the settlement. The importance of a rapid formalization of the follow -up to this advances, which has already been emphasized in comment 6.2, only grows even greater, so that the uncertainty for the general hospitals is kept as limited as possible.

Article 310. In Article 3 of the draft writable "the distribution of the amount (not: advance) referred to in Article1". Article 511. The question arises as to whether the "redistribution (...) in the partial budget objectives of medical care" arise "" , of which it is mentioned in Article 5 of the draft, should ultimately not be formalized in an adjustment of the budget 2020, since resources are transferred by budget credits. In that case, an initiative will have to be taken for this purpose.

The general hospitals and the care providers in hospitals are checked with different additional costs Or a decrease in income compared to their normal operation. These are costs related to the implementation of the emergency plans that have a large, unforeseen impact on the normal activity, for additional costs for material, staff, changes of the structure, etc., as well as for loss of income (fees, fixed ones. .) Due to the cancellation of planned interventions, both for patients who are admitted to the hospital and for the ambulatory patients. The financial resources that the hospitals generally have, are not sufficient, in particular with regard to thesaurie, for those exceptional additional costs together with a decrease in a decrease in the income, to offer the head (large purchases, payment of staff, coverage of loss of activity, in particular for doctors and other care providers, and the requirements of the suppliers to make full payment in the event of a ordered full payment). In the first instance the legal and regulatory mechanism must be put into effect to release financial resources so that a thesaurie is quickly Aviation The General Hospitals can be granted and for the time being to determine the rules for the distribution of that advance over the hospitals. In a subsequent phase, the provisional rules will be determined for the distribution of that advance on the post "fees" at the destination of the care providers, Including the candidate-doctors specialists and the hospital manager via the retrocessions are unable to agree in each hospital and the other items are charged to the hospital. Subsequently, a regularization will be made via a definitive settlement of the awarded advance. The goal is To make a comparison possible between the provisional budgets, as an advance, and the acceptable actual financial impact (costs and lower income). It will be ensured that the regularizations take into account all the budgets granted and that there is no single -subbelible financing. A working group from the Federal Hospital Facilities Sales Council give advice on the rules regarding the regularization of the posts charged to the hospital, that is the will say covered by the budget of the financial resources of the hospitals or by any other financing that belongs to the competence of the RIZIV, and on the measures that must be taken in the short and medium -term period in the context of the same budget. A working group ad hoc, compiled from Representatives of the hospital federations, representatives of the doctors' syndicates, specialists in the hospitals, from the National Committee Doctors - Health Insurance Insurance Institutions, has the task of giving advice on the rules on regularization, as well as the measures that MO Food are taken in the context of the sectoralie to the competence of the RIZIV. It should be noted that this first phase of a bill of advance of a billion euros exists in a budget transfer within the insurance for medical care. Depending on the evolution of the situation and of the analyzes of derella needs that will be carried out, an additional budget could be requested in a second phase, on top of the current budget for medical care, so that the normal activities of which the over Amounts will be taken to be taken, not the jeopardy. In view of the current budget for medical care, the exceptional nature of the expenditure it will cover in the context of public health, subdivision of the government should be taken by the government and not exclusively by the global management of social security. amount will serve to cover a period that is not yet certain, the consequences of the epidemic can still be palpable. Depending on the evolution of the crisis, it is possible that the direct-financing operation must be repeated. It should be noted that the situation for the psychiatric Hospitals will be analyzed and that ad hoc measures can be taken if necessaryThe working groups will also evaluate demit measures that can be taken on the basis of Article 101 of the Cörininated Act on the hospitals and other care establishments; That article stipulates that the budget of the financial resources of the hospitals can fix the costs for the services in a flat -rate manner as a result of an epidemic or a pandemic established by the king at a decision consulted in the Council of Ministers, after advice from the High Health Council . In addition to the thesaurie problems described above, it could be covered with additional costs, including psychiatric hospitals. The current formulation of the aforementioned Article 101 can be covered by the budget of the financial resources of the hospitals that are not give rise to an allowance as referred to in the coordinated law of 14 July1994 on mandatory insurance for medical care and benefits or its implementing decisions. In the current situation, the costs that are covered by the budget of the financial resources of the hospitals and who give rise are However, it is so high that the allowance is not sufficient to cover their expansion to the enclosure of the cases COVID-19. That item must therefore be adjusted so that the costs that are normally charged but that are more than in a normal period can be charged by the budget of the financial resources of the hospitals. That possibility depends on determining the king, Decree in the Council of Ministers and after advice from the High Health Council, of a state of epidemic or pandemie. The designs that are submitted to you therefore give you the possibility to take all of the legal and regulatory measures so that that advance can be deposited on the one hand in the short term can and on the other hand any other costs in the context of the normal budget of the financial resources of the hospitals can be taken into account. The first two decisions find a legal basis in Article 5, § 1, 2 °, 3 ° and 5 ° of the Act of March 27, 2020 that authorizing the king to take measures in the fight against the distribution of the coronavirus COVID-19 (II), to safeguard the necessary reception capacity (2 °), to provide direct support to the non-profit sector (3 °) and to implement adjustments to social security law (5 °).

In Article 4, the possibility is provided for in the possibility of providing a directest tax conducting the amount calculated by the RIZIV, in the bank account of each algae Emen Hospital. In Article 5, it is explained that the released budget results from a redistribution through the minister competent for social affairs, in the partial budget objectives of medical care, in compliance with the global budget objective of the medical care that has already been set for 2020. With the Second draft Royal Decree a change is made of Article 101 of the coordinated law of 10 July 2008 at the hospitals and other care institutions. In article 1, the concept of 'fixed' coverage of the costs is deleted so that real costs can be taken into account with real costs that, based Of the advice of the working groups, it will be 'accepted' in the special conditions that can be attributed to the sanitary approach to the epidemic. In the same article, the condition also requires that the costs may not already be covered by a government system. The Draft draft Royal Decree is the necessary condition for the application of the aforementioned article 101, in particular the adoption, to the Council and after Decree and after Advice from the High Health Council, of a state of epidemic in Belgium. I have the honor to be, Sire, Vanuwe Majesty, the very respectful and very faithful servant, the Minister of Social Sea and Public Health, m.

Emergency Treatment Motivated as follows: "L'Urgenceest Motivée par (...) le fait que l'Article 101 de la Loi coordonnée du 10 Juillet 2008 sur les hôpitauxet autres établissements de Soins Permet de prendre and Charge des Frais Liéparminmin le Roi, par arrêté délibéré en Conseil des ministres, après avis du Conseil supérieur de la Santé;que l'Organisation mondiale de la santé a qualifié le coronavirus COVID-19 comme une pandémie en datedu 11 mars 2020; que l'état d' Épidémie the Coronavirus Covid-19 Doit être déterminée and Belgique. "2. Conventioning Article 84, § 3, first paragraph, of the laws on the Council of State, the departmental legislation had to limit itself to the investigation of the authority of the Steller of The act, from the legal basis, as well as the question of whether the formal requirements to be fulfilled has been met. Making the design 3. The draft of the Royal Decree submitted for advice is intended to be the existence of the COVID-19 epidemic in order to be able to apply the legal settlement on the cost coverage for services under this epidemic through the budget of financial resources, in accordance with Article 101 of the Coordinated law of 10 July 2008 `On the Hospitals and other care establishments' (hereinafter: the Hospital Act) (Article 1 of the draft). The decision to take effect on the date of it in the Belgian Official Gazette (Article2) .4. Together with two other designs of Royal Decree, the draft that is simultaneously submitted to the Council of State, whereby Article 101 of the Hospital Act is changed on the one hand to expand the extent of the eligible costs1, and on the one hand, a provisional advance regulation is provided for on the part For the general hospitals to alleviate their medium cash flow problems2. The authorized representative explained the coherence between the intermediate designs as follows: "Les Hôpitaux doivent faire face d'une part à des surcoûts (parexemple: heures supplémentaires du personnel, coûts du matériel, des vêtements de travail, ... ) et d'Autre part, l'Activation des plans d'Urgence impose unne baissedes activités non urgent.

Sans Modification De L'Article , Les Surcoûts Dans CES Services Ne Pourraient Pas être Pris and Charge. Or la crise Implique Justementune Extension Importante des Capacités d'Acacueil and Soins Intensifs à la Demande des Autharités.lanotion de `Couverture Funeral 'Prévue à l'Article 101 Paraissait` Limitante' Congerse -Limitementunement `Limitante 'Persalementunement` LimitanteUlementunementunementunelementunementunpementunelementunemente' Pleilelementunemente de Pleailelemente de Psalel, Occupé à travailler pourétablir les éléments qui seronse couverts and plus the ce qui est bouvert and période normal d'ActivitéhospitalièresNothing allows, at this stage, to conclude with certainty that the covers will most adequate packages (although the idea is not to cover at real cost either because it would imply too high administrative charges, both for hospitals and for administrations). Lamodification proposed makes it possible to cover costs which will be the subject of a royal decree ascela is provided for in article 74septies of the royal decree of April 25, 2002 relating to the fixing and liquidation of the budget of the financial means of hospitals. If the mechanism provided for in article101 has the merit of existing, it has so far never served in the context of an epidemic/pandemic. In the ducalculic framework of an upcoming BMF (after objectification and calculation of these additional costs): concretely, this will concern exercise 2021. However, hospitals must currently face major cash problems: indeed, they must assume the Usual costs (financing their staff, equipment, infrastructure, etc.), additional costs (purchases in larger volume and at higher prices, purchase of other types of equipment, etc ...) and at the same time, apart from the fixed part of the BMF which is acted Quise, their recipes are strongly said since their non -essential activities had to be stopped. And therefore, theth decree makes it possible to give a short -term response to this cash problem by liquidatingly (and not spread out in twelfth as for the BMF ), an amount by hospital allowing him, in particular, to be able to pay his staff to understand in the broad sense, that is to say, including the providers of Desoin. This system allows funding for fast and direct hospitals because it is distinct from the system for financing hospitals by insurer organizations and retroceded fees of care providers. Domest indicated in the report to the King, this is a first step: The decree concerning the advance indeed fixes only the amount, the current budget from which it comes, the distribution key interdictital and [the] liquidation methods (directly on an account of the hospital). A new order is in preparation, in consultation with the actors concerned (doctors, hospitals, insurer organizations) to fix the distribution methods within the hospital in order to determine what this advance covers, and the regularization methods must also be defined . In addition, depending on the evolution of the crisis and the time of this one, it is not excluded to have to take an additional measure for a new advance. In summary, a decree makes it possible to respond to the acute cash problem, a Second helps guarantee the management of additional costs and the third allows you to trigger Lesecond (epidemic).
