As a result, an update of these provisions is imposed on.a) art. 105, Primary, 1 °, a), KB/WIB 92 in Article 105, first paragraph, 1 °, a), KB/WIB 92 is currently referred to by the law of 22 March 1993 on the status of and the supervision of the Credit institutions. This referral is, however, outdated, since this law has since been canceled and is currently being replaced by the law of 25 April 2014 on the status of and the supervision of credit institutions. As a result, this draft aims to replace the existing reference to the aforementioned Act of 22 March 1993 with the reference to the aforementioned law of 25 April 2014.Art.105, first paragraph, 1 °, e), KB/WIB 92Thet Royal Decree of 20 March 2007 implementation of Article 27bis of the Royal Decree No 43 of 15 December 1934 on the check on decapitory firms, the aforementioned Royal Decree No. 43 with elaboration from 31 December 2007. The status of the capitalization companies was therefore lifted more than ten years ago and the Transitional provisions provided for with this cancellation have since been extinguished. As a result, it is advisable to lift the reference to it.Art. 105, first paragraph, 1 °, f) - g), KB/WIB 92The Royal Decree no. 225 of 7 January 1936 to regle the mortgage releases and to design the control of the companies of mortgage loans, as well as the law of 4 August 1992 on the mortgage credit, were canceled by Article 53 of the 19APRIL 2014 Law containing book VII "Payment and Credit Services" in the Code of Economic Right, containing the definitions specific to Book VII and of the penalties for the infringements Opboek VII, in the books I and XV of the Code of Economic Law and containing various other provisions.

This provision is adjusted by referring to the included in that Code relevant articlesThe law of 12 June 1991 on the consumer credit was also canceled by Article 53 of the aforementioned Act of 19 April 2014. The status of the lender on consumer credit was integrated together with the statute of the lenders concerning mortgage credit in the Economic Law Code.

For example, the Flemish housing company was formed to the Flemish Society for Social Living, and the names of the Flemish Housing Fund of the Great Families and the Société Régionale Wallonne du Logement were easily abbreviated to the Flemish Housing Fund and the Société Wallonne Du Logement. Housing Fund of the Bond der Kroostrijke families of Belgium, which has since merged into its regional legal successors as a result of the regionalization of the housing authority. As a result, it is no longer necessary to mention it explicitly. In addition, the Walloon regional has set up a new public law company, in particular the Société Wallonne du Crédit Social, which aims to grant social mortgage and other credits. It is therefore necessary to explicitly state this newly established company. In addition, this provisional director must be taken into account of some policy changes. For example, the Flemish Housing Code adapted the new local housing companies since this adjustment has been made by the Flemish Government Wantenskent and therefore no longer by the Flemish Society for Social Living. In the Flemish Region, the authority was subsequently delegated to the Energiehuizen to meet energy loans in favor of determined social groups. The new Société Wallonne du Crédit Socialnuw also works in the Walloon Region with local partners who can conclude credits on its own initiative. Since this also belong to the scope of this provision, it is necessary to make the description of this.
