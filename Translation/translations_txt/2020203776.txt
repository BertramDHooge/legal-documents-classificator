The design was investigated by the first holiday room on August 6, 2020. The Chamber was composed of Jan Clement, State Council, Chairman, Jeroen van Nieuwenhove and Pierre Barra, State Councils, Jan Velaers , Assessor, and Astrid Truyens, clerk. The report was issued by Cedric Jenart, Deputy Auditeur. The sake of the French and Dutch text of the advice was checked under the Supervision ofjeroen van Nieuwenhove, State Council, the text of which follows below , is given on 7 August 2020.1. According to Article 84, § 1, first paragraph, 3 °, of the laws on the Council of State, coordinated on January 12, 1973, the request for advice must be specified by the urgent nature of its emergency. Motivated as follows: "Vu l'Urgence motivée par le fait que le coronaviruscovid-19-se propage encore à l'échelle global et qu'il y a nouveau, the manière plus spécifique surlee territory Européen, des foyers de l'épidémie, etc. que des Mesures Urgentes Sont Prises Pour Réduirele Risque Pour La Santé Publique; Vu Le fait qu'il y a Encore des Travailleurs Indépendantsqui sont forcés De Continuer à Interrompre Totalement Ou Partielles Leur's Visépendicte's Visépendicte's Visépendicte's Visépendicte's Visépendicte's Visépendiction Juin 2020 Portant des mesuresd'urgence pour limiter la propagation du coronavirus covid-19 et dans les arrêtés successifs (il s'agiten l'Accurnence des Entrepreneprises Dance Les Sect EURS encore fermés au-delà de la phase 4 du déconfinementou des Secteurs Dont l'Actrité dépend principalement des Secteurs Mentionnés Ci-Avant), La Mesure Temporary Crise de Droit Passerelle Est Prolongée Jusqu'AU 31 Décembre; Vu le fait queles travailleurs indépendants des secteurs qui de été gravement touchés par leses prises par Legouvertiger et qui de rorisés à reprendre leur activité indépendante mai -un supeil, Lainaine temporary à la reprisseest Prolongée jusqu'au 31 Octobre 2020 Incluses; It is possible to accept urgency, partly in view of the fact that the current regulation of the law of bridging in favor of the self -employed ends on 31 August 2020 and that a request for advice on thirty calendar days.2. In accordance with Article84, § 3, first paragraph , of the coordinated laws on the Council of State, has The legislative department must limit the investigation of the authority of the author of the action, of the legal basis, as well as the question of whether the formal requirements to be fulfilled has been met. Making the draft 3The draft of the Royal Decree submitted for advice is primarily to the extension top 31 December 2020 of the law of bridging in favor of the self -employed, helpers and cooperators who are forced to interrupt their activities in part or fully and insofar as activities belong to the activities such as the activities such as the activities such as referred to in the Ministerial Decree of 123 March 2020 and any other later ministerial decision -containing urgent measures to limit the distribution of the Coronavirus COVID 19, or depend on these activities. (1) The more general right to the general in favor of the self-employed, helpers and cooperating spouses, regardless of their activities, in the case of a forced interruption of at least seven consecutive calendar days as a result of COVID-19, (2) is not extended and will run until 31 August 2020. The design provides second place in the extension until 31 October 2020 with the support for restarting because of the lifting of the restrictions or prohibition on their activity in the context of COVID-19 Agreement Ministerial Decree of 23 March 2020 and any other Later Ministerial Decree on urgent measures to limit the distribution of the Coronavirus COVID-19. (3) Legal ground4.The Decree on the Legal Fund in Article 6, § 2, first paragraph, of the Act of 23 March2020 'amending the law of 22 December 2016 containing a right of bridging of the self -employed and the introduction of temporary measures In the context of COVID-19 to Funstevan Self-employed '. In this legal provision, the King is authorized to, in a decision laid down in the Council of Ministers, to extend the period of application of the measures referred to in Articles 3.4bis, 4ter and 5 of that Act until 31 December 2020 at the latest that extension follows at the expiry of the period of special powers (4) on the basis of which diepaling was inserted by a specialty -not -decision decision, (5) does not alter the fact that the king is fond of that with the fact that the duration of validation of a special fee within that period of special features to extend the set arrangement. (6-7) After all, it is an authorization that is limited to the extension of the temporal scope of a clearly defined measure, which, moreover, cannot be considered an essential element of a person reserved by the Constitution to the legislator. Such a measure can also be ratified as a legal basis for ordinary royal decisions that do not have to be ratified after the expiry of a special feature regulation. Compatibility with Articles 10, 11 and 23 of the Constitution5.1. Because the more general rights of bridging referred to in Article 4bis, § 1, of the Act of 23 March 2020 is not extended, in contrast to the bridging right referred to in Article 4bis, § 2, of the same law, a different treatment of comparable categories of self -employed persons arises depending on they carry out activities that "directly belong to the activities as intended in the Ministerial Decree of 23 March 2020 and any other later ministerial decision-making measures to limit the distribution of the Coronavirus COVID-19 Different treatment must be able to be justified in the light of the principle of equality, contained in Articles 10 and 11 of the Constitution. Significant regulation of the right of bridging must be counted as the right to social security as referred to in Article 23, third paragraph, 2 °, of, of the Constitution, for which the Constitutional Court a stand Ill principle has recognized, (8) is a reduction to a considerable degree of protection level that is offered by the applicable legislation, moreover, only if there are reasons related to the public interest. (9) 5.2. In that context, the General Management Committee for the Social Statute of the Self-employed in its advice 2020/14 of 28 July 2020 noted the following (p. 6-7): "With [de] introduction of the TCM-Oor is at the start of the crisis opted in March for one-support scheme that could be operationalized quickly and would be accessible in an accessible way for the large group of self-employed people who were professionally affected by the COVID-19 epidemic. Acute character of the situation and of the size and severity of the socio-economic impact that resulted from it. However, after that first phase, it is dependent on the support of the self-employed person being the most serious (still) affected by the crisisHowever, it is important that the support that is provided for in the coming months through the temporary expansion of the bridging right, aimed at all self-employed persons who have financial support due to a serious decrease in income as a result of the limiting measures surrounding COVID-19. The committee points out that it is not an advocate to define the scope of a measure based on sectors (10). After all, it is not always easy to bring an activity under one or the other sector. In addition, very different activities in practice can belong under the same sectorress or, conversely, a certain activity can belong or be housed in more than one -sector. It is therefore by no means obvious to justify on objective or acceptable grounds why activities from one sector would fall under the scope of a certain measure of activities from another sector. According to the Committee, a sector -specific approach also means the danger of (a sense of) discrimination. It is therefore of the opinion that the support measures in the first instance must be aimed at all self -employed persons and that the target group is subsequently detected on the basis of the allocation criteria. In this way, all independent support may be needed, regardless of their activity sector, and any form of discrimination can be avoided. From this point of view, the committee therefore takes an important comment to refer to the MB of 23 March for the closer definition of the scope area of the temporary crisis measures bridging right. After all, this reference makes access to the system sector-dependent. In its advice 2020/06, the Committee already drawn attention to the often precarious situation of the self-employed person for those who have never applied for a temporary interruption in the context of combating COVID-19, But those that are (have been) confronted with a significant income or turnover loss as a result of the Coronacrisis. The committee thinks, for example, of certain self -employed persons who are active as a taxi driver (11) or photographer (12) and some retailers such as certain chocolatiers (13). The current rules, the self -employed from these sectors, are currently not automatically eligible for the right to bridge Support for the restart and there may be a threshold (14) to intervene for the temporary crisis measure bridging right. The committee likes to see a solution for the same owners in the short term. (...) Check to what extent and in which the existing system should be adjusted so that I) it mainly focuses on the self -employed person the most needs of it but II) at the same time All self -employed people in such precarious circumstances are a delicate exercise. However, according to the committee it is necessary, both in the light of delegitimity of the system and from a budget point of view (cf. Infra). The committee will make this exercise in its evaluation, inter alia based on the available figures and the findings from the practice. This will formulate the recommendations for adjustment. "5.3. When comparing the bridging right referred to in Article 4bis, § 1, of the law of 23 March 2020 and the bridging rights intended in Article 4bis, § 2, of the same law, must in any case be taken into account that in both provisions the forced nature of the interruption of the activities is mentioned, but that notion in paragraph 1 Rather, it seems to refers to a factual and economic seal case to interrupt the activities following the COVID-19 Pandemie, while paragraph2 seems to have been mainly prompted by the mandatory lockdown measures that the government has taken in the ministerial decisions that are referred to in that paragraph . That view is confirmed by the authorized representative: "The difference between art. 4bis, § 1 and 4bis § 2 has arisen to meet these sectors that were not explicitly prohibited/limited by the M.B. holding-drenching measures to limit the spread of the Coronavirus COVID-19, but which experience the factode consequences of the COVID crisis. I can hereby give you the example of, for example, a physiotherapist a speech therapist. These activities were not prohibited, but these self -employed people had no patient lake and their respective professional orders called to only treat urgencies. In order to leave this self-employed person in the cold, the bridging right was created with the additional conditions. It is indeed correct that from 31/8 these self-employed people can no longer appeal to the crisis-Bridging right4bis § 1Even more self-employed person who cannot fall under the bridging right for support of the Restart and also not under the crisis-bridging law Article 4bis § 2, will no longer be able to receive replacement benefit. The crisis-bridging right also includes until 31/8 the same ones who have to go into quarantine after a high-risk contact as far as the quarantine lasts at least 7 days. This hatch is therefore not extended. Men can indeed state that someone who falls under the MB is always legally forced to interrupt, while those who fall under Article 4bis§ 1 are actually and economically forced to interrupt 7 consecutive calendar days per month and from 1 July 2020, they must demonstrate the effective interruption between the interruption on the one hand and the COVID-19 crisis on the other hand on the basis of objects that indicate that its pandemic and the paralyzing effect on a part of the economy, the NEog always impossible make to start the activity in full (including those who can start Quarantraineite). This regulation under 4bis, § 1 ceases to exist on 31/8. "5.4. The objective difference in the nature of the forced nature of the stopping of the activities in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 4bis of the law From March 23, 2020, a start of accountability can be in the light of Articles 10, 11 and 23 of the Constitution. It can be assumed that the government can be considered to be a broader extent to be responsible for the lens of the speaking direct or indirect economic consequences for self-employed, helpers and cooperators of the lockdown measures that the government itself has issued with a view to combating the COVID-19-Pandemie (paragraph 2), then that the government should be responsible for the recovery of nadle economic consequences for these persons be a result of the COVID-19 Pandemie, but for which there is not a causal relationship with those lockdown measures (paragraph 1), however, does not alter the fact that the government has considered it desirable to provide compensation in the form of a bridging right in the second case under certain conditions and that the stopping of that compensation cannot be justified because there is no sufficient causal bandage with the Lockdown measures of the government. The legislation of the Council of State does not have the required insight into the specific consequences for the different categories of self -employed people, helpers and cooperating spouses, depending on the activity they perform, of the stopping of the bridging right In Article 4bis, § 1, of the Act of 23 March 2020, to be able to judge whether this cancellation is compatible with Articles 10, 11 and 23 of the Constitution. the king in this limitis to whether or not to extend the aforementioned legal provisions and that A possible substantive adjustment of the Regulation on the Bridging Law, which is also All called in the advice of the Algemeen Management Committee for the Social Statute of the Self -employed, is the case of the legislator. The Inelk case is extremely advisable that the scaffolders of the draft are adequately and substantiated accountability Work out the light of these constitutional provisions and include them in a report to the king when the decision is made. Activities that are prohibited or limited at Lockdown measures of local government 6.1. As has already been explained in Article 4bis, § 2, of the Act of 23 March 2020 mentioned activities that "directly belong to the activities as intended in the Ministerial Decree of 23 March 2020 and any other later ministerial decision-making measures to to limit the distribution of the Coronavirus COVID-19, or depend on these activities ". The question arises as to whether the activities that are limited or prohibited by the supplemental sockdown measures that are currently contained in the police regulation of the Governor of the Provincials of 5 August 2020 'concerning additional measures in the fight against the Coronaviruscovid-19', which also include. (15) The authorized representative then replied the following: "The same ones who are taken by the restrictive and closing measures in the law of 23 March2020 consciously described in a broad way, namely those who are forced to fully interrupt their activities in part and insofar as their activities belong directly to the activities as intended in the Ministerial Decree of 23 March 2020 and any other later ministerial decision-making measures to limit the distribution of the COVID-19 Coronavirus.Also a sufficient land to enjoy the crisis-bridging right on the basis ofart 4, § 2. It is therefore indeed the intention that also the situations where there are limitations imposed by the municipality or province, these are a land of the Liège of the Bridging Law. Art. 23 leave to the municipalities and governments of administrative police to take additional preventive measures and in that sense the preventive measures can make a connection of certain establishments or a ban on certain activities that are eligible for the self-employed person for the crisis Bridging rights in accordance with Article 4, § 2. Currently this is also already applied for the markets and fairs that are also focused on the approval of the municipal government (but then on the basis of Article 9 MB 30/6/2020). We leave the example of Take the fairs: these are currently not admitted anymore and, in addition, it will therefore be able to appeal to Article 4bis, § 2. "6.2. The response of the attorney can be deduced that a broad interpretation is used from the relationship between the activities referred to in article 4bis, § 2, of the law of 23 March 2020 and the ministerial decision of 30 June 2020 'containing urgent measures to The distribution of the Coronavirus COVID-19), (16), by the way, not only with regard to lockdown measures that go out of a provincial governor but also of municipal or possibly even other competent authorities. With the view of the legal certainty, however, it is advisable to make the aforementioned legal provision in this way to adjust that spacious gestation quickly as possible in its text. Research of the Text Hef7.Gelet on what has been explained in comment 4 regarding the legal basis for the designed decision, should be referred more precisely to the first paragraph of the preamble to Article 6, § 2, first paragraph, of the Act of 23 March 2020. article 18.
