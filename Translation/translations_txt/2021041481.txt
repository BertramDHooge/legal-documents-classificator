Van Quickenborne______notakamer of representatives of the people (www.dekamer.be): Pieces: 55-1922integral report: 6 May 2021Publication: 2021-05-17Numac: 2021041481 Flemish Government 7 May 2021.-Decree of the Flemish Government amending the decision of the Flemish Government of 15 May 2020 regulating certain temporary measures with regard to subsidies in the Sports policy field by the civil emergency situation With regard to public health pursuant to the Coronavirus COVID-19, with regard to the 2021rechtsgrondit Decree subsidies, is based on:-the decree of 20 March 2020 on measures in the event of a civil emergency situation with regard to public health, Article 5. Form-requiring following form requirements are fulfilled :- The Finance Inspectorate gave advice on 27 April 2021.- No advice was requested from the Council of State, with application of Article 3, § 1, of the laws on the Council of State, coordinated on January 12, 1973. er. Is a matter of necessity because the consequences of the coronacrisisen the federal coronavirus measures must be taken as quickly as possible Epakt. In addition, it is of fundamental stake that beneficiaries of a subsidy also get clarity as quickly as possible about their subsidies and about the associated administrative obligations before 2021. The measures taken by the National Security Council of 12 March 2020 with regard to the coronavirus and the resulting measures of the competent authorities with a view to civil security, as a result of which spaces in which the public performance is delivered must be concluded and sports activities must be stopped, Of course have a particularly large impact on the sports sector. The recent evolutions and the linked measures to this show that this impact on the sports sector will also be significant in 2021. There is a lot of concern and uncertainty in the sports sector. The sports sector on certain administrative obligations must therefore, because of legal certainty, be given the possible impact on subsidies 2021. Certainly in the light of the phased restart of sports activity sporting events that will be able to go back under limitations must continue immediately can be given clarity. Motivationdit decision is based on the following motives:-the decree of 20 March 2020 on measures in the event of a civil emergency situation with regard to public health in Article 5 grants the Flemish government the authority to relate to a civement sood situation with regard to elaborate further rules for the suspension, destroying or the extension of procedural periods or the temporary adjustment of procedural or administration obligations in various decrees and the implementing decisions to ensure maximum legal certainty. This applies to community and regional matters. The Coronacrisis and the FederalecoronaVirus measures have a direct impact on certain administrative obligations in various recognition and subsidy schemes with regard to the Sports Policy Field. That is why the Flemish Government, on 15 May 2020, took the decision to regulate certain temporary measures with regard to subsidies in the Sports policy field by the civil emergency situation with regard to the public health in the Coronavirus COVID-13 good. Because the pandemic continues, a number of the temporary measures must also be continued in 2021.- It is also fair in 2021 also the costs of beneficiaries of a subsidy within the policy field sport for activities or events that have not, or have adjusted or limited Pursuant to the civil emergency situation under the Coronaviruscovid-19, to be paid within the limits of the granted subsidy and taking into account the subsidy conditions. In this way, as much as possible is avoided that financial problems arise for the beneficiaries. This is about payouts are already foreseen and therefore do not generate additional costs for the Flemish government. The law of 20 December 2020 containing various temporary and structural provisions regarding the framework of the fight against the distribution of the COVID-19 Coronavirus ensures that VZW's can definitively use the General meeting from a distance. It is possible to organize the general meeting digital or in writing. The regulation from Article 2 of the Decree of the Flemish Government of 15 May 2020 will therefore be canceled.- Some sports federations may be confronted with a large loss of members by the Coronapandemie (also) in 2021, whether or not combined (very) limited (HER ) Inflow of members. One of the recognition conditions of a sports federation is permanently meet the condition for having 500 affiliated membersRecognized sports federation that is confronted with a (large) loss of members could opt for the membership of 2019 to be exceptionally eligible in 2020. In 2021 it is fair to have the option to leave the membership of 2019 or 2020 open. That possibility is also offered to the organizations for sporting leisure activities. The subsidization of the sports federations is a lot of points depending on the number of affiliated members. That is why the sports-federationed choice is left to allow the parameter to depend on the number of subsidized members on the number of membership in 2019 or 2020.- The postponement of the Olympic and Paralympic Games has an unforeseen impact on the BOIC and the current list of costs that are eligible for subsidization . A number of preparation internships and competitions have been canceled or postponed for an indefinite period, other initiatives of top athletes and their program have been started or intensified .- The umbrella Student sports organization must, with application of Article 4 of the Decree of 3 April 2009, award of subsidies for the extension , The coordination and promotion of the sports offer of Destudent sports facilities of the Flemish universities and colleges and the recognition and subsidization of a Flemish umbrella student organization, annually at least 10% of the subsidy spent the concrete organization of the student sportsinitiatives of the Student Sportunihood. By the Coronapandemie and the Corona measures, certain associations and international student sports initiatives are organized by the Corona Pandemie and Corona Megen. That is why that minimum spending percentage is not imposed in 2021.-the Flemish Community Commission and the organization for the supervision of the local authorities that subsidy through the Decree 6 July 2012 on stimulating and subsidizing a local sports policy as a result of the measures in the framework of the coronacrisis do not meet some decree conditions. A deviation is therefore permitted in the field of the spent rates imposed. This also applies in 2021.- To the organization for coordination and employment of single-pool of sports supervisors and sports supports, a spending obligation is imposed annually in the area of ​​the execution of part of part of Their assignment in the bilingual area of ​​Brussels-Capital. The planned initiatives have an impact due to the coronacrisis, which means that the organization, outside Haarwil, may not be able to meet this spending obligation. That is why in 2021 that minimal action amount is not imposed.- For many sports infrastructure projects that are subsidized on the basis of various project calls within the Sports policy field, the deadline within which a project must be realized is no longer feasible. Due to the civil emergency situation with regard to public health pursuant to the Coronavirus COVID-19, contractors can temporarily not carry out the works or they are confronted with supply problems of building materials. A postponement of the Deadline Voorde in 2020 is ongoing projects from one year to two years, given the duration of the Pandemie, fair. For 2021 newly awarded Subsidies Sport infrastructure is granted a year of postponementLegal Characterist Decree with the following regulations:- the decree of 3 April2009 containing the granting of subsidies for the expansion, coordination and promotion of the sports offerings of the student sports facilities of the Flemish universities and colleges and the recognition and subsidizing of a Flemish umbrella student sports organization; - the decree of 6 July 2012 containing and subsidizing a local sports policy- the decree of 8 November 2013 on stimulating, coordinating and subsidizing employment in the sports sector;- the Decree of 10 June 2016 containing recognition and subsidization of the organized sports sector;-the decree of 5 May 2017 on support of supra-local sports infrastructure and top sport infrastructure;-the decision of the Flemish Government of 20 December 2013 on the implementation of the Decree of 8 November 2013 containing stimulation, coordination and subsidizing TEW Erkstelling in the sports sector;- the decision of the Flemish Government of 16 November 2012 on the implementation of the Decree of 6 July 2012 containing and subsidizing a local sports policy;- the decision of the Flemish Government of 16 September 2016 establishing the General recognition and subsidy conditions for the organized sports sector- the decision of the Flemish government of 27 January 2017 on the implementation of the Decree of 10 June 2016 containing the recognitions subsidization of the organized sports sector regarding the adoption of the conditions for a subsidy for implementation of the Policy Focus Topsport. initiative cerem decree is proposed by the Flemish Minister of Education, Sport, Animal Welfare and Flemish Rand.
