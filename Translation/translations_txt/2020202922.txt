The buePublication: 2020-07-08NUMAC: 2020202903Federal Public Service Policy and Support Federal Public Service Social Security 26 June 2020.-Royal Decree No. 39 amending the Royal Decree of 28 March 1969 establishing the list of occupational diseases that give rise to compensation and to Determining the criteria to which exposure to the professional risk must meet for some of these diseases due to COVID-19 Report to the Koningsire, the Royal Decree of which we have the honor of submitting your Majesty to signing, on the basis of the law of March 27, 2020 that authorization grants the king to take measures in the fight against the spread of the Coronavirus COVID-19 (II), urgent measures to take the employees in companies of the crucial sectors and the essential services that continued their professional activities without it without to be able to adhere to the rules of Social Distan Cing or without being able to work in the period from 18 March 2020 to 17 May 2020. The increase in social contact increases the risk of infection, given the method of transferring the virus. That is why the government has opted for a lockdown of the population and a number of associated measures, such as the recovery of jobs where the rules of social distancing cannot be observed, the closure of certain businesses, maximum use of telework or the prohibition of certain events. The aim is to reduce social interactions in order to limit the risk of infection as much as possible. However, The activities was permitted, despite the increased risk of infection due to continuation of Vandeze activities. These companies are included in an appendix to the Ministerial Decree of 23 March2020 on urgent measures to limit the distribution of the COVID-19 Coronavirus. The Ministerial Decree and the Annex were regularly adapted to the decisions of the National Security Council with regard to the sectors that may continue or resume their activities. Employee in companies of the crucial sectors and the essential services have continued to work without lectures on the rules of social distancing, therefore, there was a greater risk of COVID-19.Thousy legislation on occupational diseases does not allow all employees to cover in case Vanbes infection with COVID-19. Only staff involved in prevention, care, home care or laboratory works other professional activities in care institutions where an increased risk of infection exists, can be able to be able to suffer an occupational disease (under code 1.404.03). The Minister of Social Necks has the management committee for the occupational diseases of the occupational diseases of the occupational diseases of the occupational diseases of the occupational diseases Fedris therefore asked to check whether the list of the persons who can be eligible for compensation for occupational disease after exposure to COVID-19 can be expanded and under what conditions. The Minister of Civil Service has asked to take persons working in the public sector into account. The Management Committee has examined this and proposed possible extensions. This decision has Temporary, in the context of the special special assigned by the aforementioned law of 27 March 2020 powers, an exception scheme to make the recognition of COVID-19 as an occupational disease possible for employees in companies of the crucial sectors and the essential services that their professional activities have to continue without being able to telecute and without being able to adhere to the Vansocial Distancing rules The exercising of a professional activity in contact with other people without social distancing can be guaranteed, entails a specific risk of infection. This risk does not exist for the population in general during the Lockdown period where the social contacts are kept to a minimum, and nor for Wer Knemers who carry out their work through telework or metin for the rules of social distancing. This specific risk remains no interpersonal contacts in existence for the general population. have social contact. From May 18, 2020 it will therefore no longer be possible to assume that the performance of the activities in this design aimed at exposure to COVID-19 that is considerably higher than that of the population is general, or even inherent to the activity performedThat is why the coverage for occupational diseases for occupational diseases is therefore limited in time and intended for employees who have practiced professional activity in the periods of decrucial sectors and the essential services in the Periodevan on 18 March 2020 to 17 May 2020, insofar as the disease is determined In the period from 20 March 2020 to 31 May 2020. The dates 20 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 were chosen because they reflect the Hans scientifically accepted incubation time of the disease, i.e. between 2 and 14 days after exposure to the virus. In concrete terms, this means that no more than 14 days may be passed by the date of the last actual working day outdoors (i.e., not telecommuting) and the occurrence of the disease. With regard to the evidence that is met the conditions of exposure of the range risks as formulated in the appendix to The Royal Decree of 28 March 1969 can be applied with all legal resources. As a social security institution, Fedris will cooperate in the burden of proof, as with each request for recognition of an occupational disease, to the applicant to give what proof of him is expected, if the request cannot be granted immediately. The very concrete activities on the field of employees must be charged. With regard to the proof that it is impossible to maintain a distance of 1.5 meters in the contacts with other people, Fedris will probably not be able to assess on the basis of a series of instructions, depending on the nature of the activity, to what extent precautionary precautions are likely not can be observed to the letter. Single -police patrol that carries out an intervention, for example, it is difficult to consider a distance of 1.5 m. It is necessary because the introduction of a new sickness code itself, in view of the exceptional situation, can entail problems for the compensation as a result of it The existence of specific provisions of the coordinated laws of 3 June 1970: - Article36, second paragraph, stipulates: 'If the temporary incapacity for work or death have occurred before the registration of the disease on the list referred to in Article 30, then the hit or His beneficiaries claim compensation from the date on which the disease was registered '; Article 52, fourth paragraph, stipulates:' (...) In the cases of temporary disability, the applications must be submitted, or in the course of the period of temporary incapacity for work, whether or not interrupted by one or more periods of Werkverherva ating, either in the period where symptoms of the occupational diseases are present. ". The application of these provisions would, until the compensation for temporary incapacity for work, would only be able to be able to be able to withdraw from the date of entry into force of the Royal Decree to include the new code In the list of occupational diseases, provided that the person concerned still exhibits disease symptoms when submitting the application-- the compensation as a result of death could only start from the date of entry into force of the decision to include the new code in the list of occupational diseases. Since it is a temporary regulation that is justified by exceptional consideration, the application of these rules must be avoided, if not, the proposal -partic is losing the intended use. Because they are taken in the context of temporary and preliminary measures of special powers, it was also deemed desirable not to include the temporary removal of these two -determinations directly in the Royal Decree of 28 March 1969, to make the text Nonodeless and complicated. The explanation given above on the procedure for the recognition of the occupational disease on the one hand and the limited area of ​​application in the time and silk tones is sufficiently sufficiently established that these limitations have been established in order to combat any form of discrimination in relation to other victims of occupational diseases and that they are therefore fully in accordance with with the constitutional principles of equality and non-discrimination. Until the situation we have had to deal with because of COVID-19 and the reflections that followed about the coverage of occupational diseases by the system of occupational diseases, we realize that this regulation should be re-resident, or even reformed, taking into account new diseases that we will have to make in the future.In Article 1 of the Royal Decree of 28 March 1969 establishing the list of occupational diseases that rule on compensation and establishing the criteria that exposure to the vocational risk for some of these diseases, a new code number 1,404.04 is inserted for the employees who have exercised a professional activity in companies of the crucial sectors and the essential services included in the appendix to the Ministerial Decree of 23 March 2020 containing urgent measures to limit the spread of Coronavirus COVID-19TE. Art. 2. This article records the exposure criteria for this new code in the appendix to the aforementioned Royal Decree of 28mart 1969. 3. Since it concerns a temporary regulation that is justified by exceptional considerations, the application of these rules must be set aside, so that these rules do not largely destroy the expected usefulness of the proposal.art.art.4. This article determines the date of entry into force of the Decree.

In application of Article4, first paragraph, of the Law of 27 March 2020, which authorizes the King to increase measures in the fight against the spread of the Coronavirus COVID-19 (I) ', which refer to items 84, § 1 , first paragraph, 3 °, of the laws on the Council of State, coordinated on January 12 ,1973, the legislation department had to limit itself to the investigation of the competence of the Stellervan the act, of the legal basis, as well as the question or to The formal requirements to be fulfilled has been paid.

The Public Prosecution Service, the OM Advies, temporarily for it, in the context of the law of 27 March 2020 'that authorization grants a) to take the Koningom measures in the battle Against the distribution of the Coronavirus COVID-19 (II) ', an exception regulation to carry out the recognition of each disease caused by SARS COV-2 as an occupational disease possible Temaken for employees in companies of n the crucial sectors and the essential services that their professional activities have to continue without being able to telecute and without being able to adhere to the rules of VANSOCIAL DISTANCINGTo this end, Article 1 of the Royal Decree of 28 March 1969 'Consideration of the list of occupational diseases gives rise to compensation and establishing the criteria that have to meet exposure to the professional risk for some of these diseases' a new code number for for the established period to cover the relevant employees (Article 1 of the draft); Articles 36, second paragraph, and 52, fourth paragraph, of the 'laws concerning occupational diseases and the compensation for the damage resulting from those diseases are coordinated top 3 June 1970' (hereinafter: Occupational Diseases Act) in the context of recognition of that new code not declared in application (Article 2); In the annex to the Royal Decree of 28 March 1969 decriteria for exposure concerning the new code (Article 3) and the King is authorized to extend the application of the designed decision to the application of a Professional activity by the employees involved If new lockdown measures are imposed (Article 4). Article 5 of the draft stipulates that the Decree to be taken elaboration has effect from 18 March 2020. Article 6 of the draft contains the implementation provision. 3. The first paragraph of the preamble of the draft shows that the draft legal basis is being sought in Article 5, § 1, 3 ° and 5 °, of the law of 27 March 2020 (ii). 3.1. Article 2 of the Act of 27 March 2020 (II) stipulates that in order to make Belgium possible to respond to the coronaviruscovid-19-epidemic or pandemic and to compensate for its consequences, the king, in a decision, determined in the Council of Ministers, the In Article 5, § 1, 1 ° to 8 °, take the measures can be taken and that these measures may, if necessary, have a retroactive effect, which, however, will not go back further than 1 March 2020. With the eye on the in Article 2, first paragraph, of the Law of 27 March 2020 (ii) mentioned objectives, authorizes Article 5, § 1, 3 ° and 5 °, of that law to take the Kingom in particular measures to offer direct or indirect support to or protection measures on the one hand For the affected financial sectors, the economic sectors, the profit and non-profit sector, the companies and households to limit the consequences of the pandemic and, on the other hand, to make adjustments in labor law and social security law , with a view to the protection of the employees and the population, the good organization of the companies and the government, with indemnification of the economic interests of the country and the continuity of the critical sectors. The explanatory notes was given to the proposal that has led to the law of 27 March 2020 (II) that it will also be able to quickly get the necessary authorization in the area of ​​support to the economic sectors and households to be able to get the existing authorizations that are already provided for in the integral legislation action within its competence domain, by taking direct or indirect support measures that are navigated flanking measures, such as deferment or guarantee schemes. It was also pointed out in the explanation that employment law and social security rights may occur in which the existing legal framework does not allow to reconcile measures for the need for permanent economic production or services because of the public health, both in the private sector and In the public sector, for example because of the telephotoic of the changes in the timetable.33.2. The authorized representative provided the following explanation with the aforementioned legal basis: "Conernantla référence au préambule au 3 °, une protection social adequate pour les travailleurs ressortissantaux Santé et aux sectore LATIELL pandémie sont prises peutvent être vues comme étant des mesures de soutien direct ouindirect.c'est toutefois la référence au 5 ° qui constitue la base principale du fondement légalede l'Arrêté and projet quui la protection As an occupational disease of each disease caused by SARS-COV-2 that is limited over time, applies to a specific group of employees. The regulation in question therefore therefore relates to adjustment of social security law with a view to the protection of employees. Consequently, Article 5, § 1, 5 °, of the law of 27 March 2020 (ii), provides a sufficient legal basis for the designed regulation and serves The reference to Article 5, § 1, 3 °, of that Act to be deleted in the first paragraph of the preamble of the draft. Investigation of the Tekstalgemengemering4.1Pursuant to Article 30, first paragraph, of the Occupational Diseases Act, the Koning Delijst prepares for occupational diseases that give rise to compensation, on the proposal of the scientific council established in Fedris4 (Article 16 of the occupational disease law). The King can be on the basis of Article 32, third paragraph, of the same law for some occupational diseases for diseases as referred to in Article 30bis of that Act, record exposure criteria, on the proposal of the management committee and after advice of the scientific council. By introducing the designed regulation regulation for the Recognition of every disease caused by SARS-COV-2 as an occupational disease for employees in companies of the crucial sectors and the essential services who had to continue their professional activities during the Lockdown period without being able to work and without being able to adhere to the rules of social distancing and becoming folkedblootstellin Gscriteria established. Neither the inclusion on the list of occupational diseases nor the determination of the exposure criteria happened with the intervention of the scientific council, which, however, was considered essential for the creation of the list of occupational diseases the determination of the exposure criteria. Temporisvan the designed regulation that relates, on the one hand, on the period from 18 March 2020 to 17 May 20205 during which the employees have practiced professional activities outdoors in companies of the crucial sectors and the essential services and, on the other hand, on the Periodevan 20 March 2020 up to and including 31 May 2020 within which the disease must be determined, the King's report was given the following clarification: "Since from May 18, 2020, phase 2 of the exit strategy will start, everyone can have social contact again from then on May 18, 2020 it will no longer be possible to assume that the exercise of the activity leads referred to in this design to expose COVID-L9 that is considerably higher than that of the population in general, or is even inherent to the activity performed. Then the coverage for occupational diseases is limited in the Time and intended for employees who have practiced professional activity in companies of the crucial sectors in the period from 18 March2020 to 17 May 2020, the essential services, insofar as the disease is determined in the period from 20 March 2020 toten with 31 May 2020 . The dates 20 March 2020 and 31 May 2020 were chosen because they now reflect the scientific incubation time of the disease, i.e. between 2 and 14 days after exposure virus. In concrete terms, this means that no more than 14 days may expire between the date of the last actual working day outdoors (i.e., not telecommuting) and the prevention of the disease. "4.2. The constitutional principle of equality and non-discrimination requires that the distinctions created cases that are and do not fall under the scope, based on an objective criterion is reasonably responsible. The existence of such accountability must be assessed in mind the purpose and consequences of the disputed measure and with the nature of the relevant principles; the principle Equality and non-discrimination have been violated when it is established that there is a very reasonable link of proportionality between the means and the intended purpose. and on the other hand Applicability in time allows time depending on certain data, determined on the basis of criteria that come across as little pertinent, let alone as scientifically substantiated. The resulting differences in this in the light of the principle of equality in the light of the decision to be taken by the decision to be taken. It will have to be investigated whether the aforementioned differences in treatment with the conditions regarding effectiveness, objectivity, pertinence and proportionality to in accordance can be considered with the constitutional principle of equality and it is recommended to include a accountability in the report to the king. The purely describing the health risk sentence, although any interpretation, is not in itself sufficient accountability in the light of the principle of equality.4.3. The changes to the Royal Decree of 28 March 1969 in order of the items to be changed design. Consequently, the provision under Article 3 of the draft must be included as Article 2 and vice versa.In view of what has been noted under 3 to 3.2 in connection with the legal basis, the first paragraph of the reference to Article 5, § 1, 3 °, of the law of 27 March 2020 (ii) must be deleted.

In this regard, the following explanation gives the following explanation: "Dance la mesure où la faculté n d'Autre pértiodes, il estinduit que de nouvelles mesures the confinement soient avant cette date prises. toute Éventue Lle prolongationsserait ipso facto facto conditionnée par la durée de ces nouvelles mesures de confinement and cas de secondevague de contamation.la Possibilité pour le roi de modifier ou remplacer les Dispositions par les esportentstroduites 'AR de 1969 et par l'Article 3 dance l'Annexe de l'Ar de 1969.L'inTentionest Effective Effectivement Que La Disposition de l'Article 2 Reste d'Application and Cas de Prolongation de l'Applicationed Code Spécifique. "9.2 . It must be pointed out that it is not necessary and, moreover, guessing that a government grants its authorization to itself. In the present case, the intention of the Stellers seems to be that the Special Affairs Decree to be taken in turn would grant a "normal" authorization to the king. The delegation assigned to the king implies that the complete temporal scope of the King's designed regulation will be able to be determined. Such a provision, which means that the king authorizes himself to extend the regulation referred to in other periods of exercising a Professional activity, does not belong in the present decision, but, where appropriate, it can be included in the Act whereby the decision is ratified. Increasing the aforementioned provision would be included in an ratification Act should be pointed out that "Article 1 and the Annex of the aforementioned Konon Decree "must be referred instead of" Articles 1 and 3 of the aforementioned Royal Decree of 28 March 1969 ".
