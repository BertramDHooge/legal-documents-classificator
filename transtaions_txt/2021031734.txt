There is an urgent necessity because the decision of the Flemish Government of November 2020 regulating a general and selective subsidy for the organizers of childcare of out-of-school care and measures for families in childcare and out-of-school care following the consequences of the COVID-19 virus in article 29 stipulates that Article 1 Toten with 24 of the Decree ceases to have an effect on June 30, 2021. When that decision was approved in November2020, there was no clear yet City about the impact of the COVID-19 virus on the Langeretermijn and the elaboration of the compensation subsidy was limited in time from caution. District that the decision ceased to have effect on March 31, 2021. Last year it has clearly become that predictions about the course and the duration of the epidemic are impossible. However, it is not intended that the Flemish government will maintain subsidies for a long time. That is why the subsidy of the Flemish Government of the Flemish Government of the Flemish Government was only extended to a limited extent until 30 June 2021. At this time, the limitation of the epidemic is going in the right direction. The intention is that full Flemish adult population will be vaccinated by 11 July 2021. It is clear that the vaccination campaignen has a major impact on the limitation of the spread of the virus among the adult population. The number of infections and hospital admissions is in a falling line. However, it is also certain that children from 0 to 12 years old, the target group of the Sectors of childcare and out -of -school care, will not have been vaccinated (yet) in July and August 2021. Spread of the virus inside that target group will therefore still take place. In those situations, partial or complete closure of a (children's) reception location will still be proceeded if there is an outbreak. Derid closure has direct consequences for the income and therefore the quality of life of the organizers. To guarantee the quality of life for the organizers That is confronted with this, it is necessary that the subsidy provided for in the decision of the Flemish Government of 13 November 2020 will also apply in the summer months, so that at least the selective compensation can be granted to accommodate COVID-13 closure. In addition, it is also clear on the basis of the experiences of the year -end year that the epidemic sometimes has unexpected twists and turns and it is also necessary from the pregnancy principle for the months of July and August, the period in which unavoidable children in the framework of the reception context frequently with each other varying groups will have contacted, to extend the subsidy system. In view of the current regulations stipulates that the compensation scheme but until the end of June 2021 applies, it is urgently necessary to approve the present decision, so that it is clear to the sectors concerned that they are also in the period July and August 2021 count on subsidy tuning if necessary. Even an advice on five days of the Council of State is not possible, since in implementation of the aforementioned decision of the Flemish Government of 13 November 2020, the Minister will have to make a decision for the end of June 2021 in which he determines for July and August which subsidies. Initiator (s) This decision is proposed by the Flemish Minister for Welfare, Public Health, Family and Poverty Reduction.
