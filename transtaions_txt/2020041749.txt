DesirPublication: 2020-07-15Numac: 2020041749Brussels-Capital Region29 May 2020.-Special-female decision of the Brussels-Capital Government No. 2020/028 to introduce a premium to support the tenants with limited income that undergo an income loss by the COVID-19 Health. - Erratumin the Belgian Official Gazette of 3 June2020, third edition, bl. 40961, deed no. 2020/41585, the report must be reported to the Government reported to the Brussels -Capital Governor's Attention of the members of the Government, the Government Decree aims to provide financial support to an important category of tenants' Binnen's Capital Region, which are professional have suffered suffering from the worldwide ability crisis as a result of the Pandemie of the Coronavirus COVID-19. The World Health Organization has indeed designated the Coronavirus COVID-19 on 11 March 2020 as Pandemie and has increased the threat level of this pandemic to the highest level on March 16, 2020.W against The number of detected infections and the number of deaths in Belgium since 13 March 2020, the federal government has issued a first-ministerial decision of 18 March 2020 "containing urgent measures to limit the distribution of the Coronavirus COVID-19". This decision imposed strict restrictions on the Belgian population. The progressive lifting of the restrictions was foreseen by a ministerial decision of 30 April 2020 "amending the Ministerial Decree of 23 March 2020 holding -driving measures to limit the distribution of the Coronavirus". These first cancellation measures in operation at national level on 4 May 2020. The strict limitation measures that are being introduced worldwide have a delay in the national and the worldwide economy. A significant number of employers were forced to rely on the temporary unemployment for their employees, while many self -employed people have not been able to continue their activity, and this with the view of compliance with the general measures to protect public health by the Belgian authorities. and regional measures were adopted to support owners of homes when they were confronted with financial, in particular the deferment of payment of the mortgage credit for a maximum of 6 months, or the extension of the payment term of the property tax up to 4 months. Legal time are support measures to tenants Introduced, in particular, the moratorium on the evictions until 31 August 2020, the shortening of the notice period for students. Despite these measures, many tenants experience any difficulties to pay their rent as a result of loss of income. As a result of the foregoing, this decision aims to grant a unique premium to tenants on the private rental market. The conditions for this support measure are primarily related to the demonstrated decrease of the professional income of a family member as a result of the health crisis the documents of the tenant for the health crisis. In its general policy statement of the Brussels -Capital Governments, the United College of the Community Commission has the Brusselsse Government priority that she attaches to the right to living confirmed. The granting of a support premium tenants is one of the resources that allows to achieve this objective; Incidentally, this is explicitly provision in the Brussels housing code that states in Article 166 that: "The region can grant a contribution to the rent to the families under the conditions that the government determines and the limits of the credits that are registered for this purpose on the regional budget.". 1. amount: the amount of the support premium is 214.68 euros per family and per home, which is turned once. The amount is equal to 2 monthly payments of 107.34 euros, this is the basic amount of the rental allowance for the candidate tenants that are registered on the lists of social housing (decision of the Brussels-Capital Government of 13 February 2014 establishing a rental allowance. The candidate tenants who are registered on the lists of social housing). cumulative allocation conditions of the premium. The tenant must have signed a lease before March 14, 2020, with and before throw the rent of a home located within the territory of the region and which is intended as his main residenceDehenters of a home made available by a public organism are excluded from the benefit of the premium, which is intended to support tenants on the private rental market, which therefore cannot fall back on the regional support measures with regard to social housing (Article 3) The loss of professional income can be complete or partial and is demonstrated by, for employees, the enjoyment of temporary unemployment benefits for at least 15 days. For the self -employed the allocation of the bridging right, or a regional equivalent to exclude the bridging right. Loss of professional income during the period of the imposed measures of social distancing Distancing Diewarden imposed by the decision of 23 March 2020 on the emergency measures to limit the spreading of the Coronavirus COVID-19, as changed, is an objective criterion that both meet the needs of the population whose income as a result of health crisis is fell, if an objective treatment of applications makes it possible. The ceilings of the net taxable income stated in Article 6 are not exceeded by the family. These income ceilings are based on the increased allowance ceilings for families for social housing. It is due to the candidate of the premium to demonstrate its net income for the tax years 2018 or 2019, on the basis of the most recent assessment notice he has, in Special with a view to any objections for the 2019 assessment year that would make it impossible for its income for this assessment year. This alternative therefore takes away the difficulty for certain taxpayers to submit a assessment notice for the 2019 assessment year. For the tax year 2020 it was not chosen in view of this vast majority of taxpayers cannot be taken out of the year at this time. The income ceilings are adjusted according to the situation of the family, and the number of incomes that this family enjoys. The ceilings, however, are increased by 3,326.16 euros for everyone's child within the family, and with 6,652.32 euros for every disabled person (child or adult) Diedeel makes up from the family. These ceilings make it possible to make this support measure as targeted, possibly possible, And to preserve her to families who already had a modest income and have the greatest need for the regional support to be able to pay the rent of their home for the period in which the limitation measures within the Kingdom were in force. The effectiveness of the measure depends on the boundaries that are set, since the region must ensure that the resources of the regional budget are efficiently allocated and in this way make it possible to continue to answer other, future economic consequences of the health crisis .3. The case of the co -tenants: in view of the popularity of the co -rent, which is often found within the Brussels -Capital Region, it is desirable to equate the co -tenants of the same home with a family. It is due to all co -tenants for a joint application serve inte for their co -rent (Article 4, § 4). This allows a complete and coherent treatment of their applications for award, in particular of the cumulative conditions that are assessed by the whole of the co -rent. The conditions regarding the family also apply to all co -tenants of the same home, so that also They are bound by the desire for the net taxable income, which will apply to the additional income of the co -tenants, as well as the condition that excludes the enjoyment of the premium for the co -tenants or the family of which one of the members has a property right or a right of usufruct on a home during the loss of income. As for the family, the condition is only met the reduction or loss of professional income if one of the co -tenants of evidence provides proof in accordance with Article 4, § 2.4. Procedure: The Procedure Precise The support premium is based as much as possible on the procedure of the BE Home premium, which is already fully managed by the Brussels Taxation Regional Public Service. In the light of its experience in this matter, this administration is to be used to the various procedural steps of the premium, the award, the possible withdrawal, the professions, and the sanctions for proven cases of fraud.
