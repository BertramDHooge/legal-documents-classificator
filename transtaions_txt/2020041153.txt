Patients who treat hospitals and healthcare institutions for COVID-19 is, is The production of risk -containing medical waste (RMA) in particular in volume increased considerably. This is the demand for suitable recipients for the collection and transport of RMA increasing considerably.ovam has made a division of medical waste based on the risk of infection in RMA NRMA (non-risk-containing). This distinction is in accordance with the provisions in VLAREMA and based on advice from expert virologists. As a result, the rise to RMA of COVID-19 patients was hoped to keep under limit. This classification has been communicated several times to the healthcare sector. Despite this measures, the volume of RMA has risen by 65% ​​during the last three weeks. All collectors of RMAMELDEN A structural shortage of regulatory packaging. The question with their customers is twice as great what they themselves get to new recipients. Some hospitals seem to have been proactively created a stock, but those who have not done this may get into trouble. Due to a deficiency of regulatory packaging, the collectors set in some hospitals or residential care centermarking situations. They see that RMA is being beaten in normal pockets, non-un-cardoons boxes, ... in places that are not suitable for this. At the hospitals, the stock of RMA vessels is different. A number of large hospitals have a stock with which they can, even in this coronacrisis, a month later. At other hospitals there was a dire RMA vessels in the first week of April. The collectors have all placed many new orders for new RMA recipients, at various suppliers, from different countries.
