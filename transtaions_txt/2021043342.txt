DaardPublication: 2021-12-20Numac: 2021043342Federal Public Service Finance 2 December 2021.-Royal Decree amending the annexes of the Royal Decree of 22 June 2020 implementing Articles 93ter to 93quinquies of the tax on the added value, the Articles 412bis, 433 to 435 of the Income Tax Code 1992, Articles 35 to 37, 43 to 45 and 47 of the Code of the amicable and forced collection of tax and non-tax claims and Articles 157 to 159 and 161 of The Program Act (i) of 29 March 2012, regarding the E-NOTariaat Report on the Koningsire, the design of Royal Decree that we submit to Your Majesty for signing, aims to implement the Royal Decree of 22 June 2020 implementing the articles 93TER TO93QUINQUIES OF THE Code of added value added, Articles 412BIS, 433 TO435 of the Income Bel Code Astingen 1992, Articles 35 to 37, 43 to 45 and 47 of the Code of the amicable and forced collection of tax and non-tax claims and the articles 157 to 159 and 161 of the Program Act (I) of 29 March 2012, regarding E -Memeaat to be entitled to entitle certain elements. In the four attachments, the tax guilty guys concerned is made by his name, fore (a) m (s) and his personal number. This personal number agrees with the identification number of the National Register or, in the absence thereof, the identification number Bij de Kruispuntbank of Social Security, or, in the absence of such numbers, the date of birth and the address. The identification on the basis of the address was added again in the context of the current design. The comment formulated under the point 3.2.3 of Advies no. 70.131/3 of the Council of State is not followed. Although it is true that when applying Article 22 of the ground law, the essential elements of a treatment of personal data must be determined in the Act itself, the categories of data can already be handled in the context of the E-NOTariat already extensively stated in the Act, and The address is only part of the identification of the persons Diebij the deed are involved. By way of example (which can be converted into Articles 412BIS EN433 of the Code of Income Taxes 1992 and in Article 93 of the Tax of the Taxover the added value), Article 35, § 1, second paragraph of the Code of the Environmental Ten provides Forced collection of tax and non-tax claims that: "The message states the identity of the sender, the property that is the object of the deed referred to in the first paragraph and the identity of the owner or holder of a commercial right to that good." , so that the categories of Data Reeds are identified in the law itself, whereby the address is only part of the identity of the owner or the holder of a commercial law. In addition, and in the majority of the traps, the parties of the deed are identified by their name, fore (a) m (s), identification number of the National Register or, in the absence of the latter, the identification number at the Kruispuntbank van de Sociale Zekerhe id. It is therefore only in rare cases that the person will be identified in addition to his name and fore (a) m (s), due to his date of birth and now his address. This answers to the technical necessity, to the extent that the E-memorandum application in the absence of an identification number, at the same time needs the date of birth and address to be able to identify the person and TEBEPALEN if this taxpayer is of debt receivables managed by the General Administration Pan de Inning and the collection. In addition, Article 6, § 3, of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of Natatural Persons in connection with the processing of personal data and concerning the free movement of those data and withdrawal of Directive 95/46/EC, which applies in the present case, since DEE notarial provisions meet an instruction of general interest, consisting of the correct and correcting of public claims, that: "3. The legal basis for The processing referred to in paragraph 1, pointsc) and e) must be determined at: a) Union law; Member State that applies to the controller. The purpose of the processing is determined or with regard to the processing referred to in paragraph 1 (1), necessary for the performance of a task of public interest or for the performance of public authority that the controller has been grantedThat legal basis may contain specific provisions to adjust the application of the rules of this Regulation, including the General Terms and Conditions of Conditions the legality of processing by the controller; the types processed data; those involved; the entities for which and the purposes for which the personal data may be provided; the target connection; the storage periods; and the processing activities and procedures, including measures to ensure legitimate and considerable processing, such as those for other specific processing situations and referred to in Chapter IX. The Union law or Member Statible Law must comply with an objective of the public interest and must be proportional to the justified goal. "This follows that the legal provisions may not contain the categories of data that are the subject of the treatment, but should not necessarily contain nor should They are a fortiori an exhaustive list of allecategories of data. In this case, the address cannot be considered an essential element, because the identification of the parties as a category has already been repeated. corresponds to the identification number at the Kruispuntbank of Enterprises, and that, in the absence of such number, the address of its seat muff are communicated.
