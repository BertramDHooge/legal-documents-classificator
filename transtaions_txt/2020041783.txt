The Government Government does not lose sight of the fact that, in accordance with Article 3, § 2, of the Decree of 17 March2020, the draft decision to the chairman of parliament will be communicated before the known Makingervan in the Belgian Official Gazette (1) .2. It is proposed, even if Article 3bis, §1, paragraph 2, of the coordinated laws "concerning the Council of State" it does not formally prescribe, to publish a report to the government at the same time as the decision in which the scope and the concrete conspiracy of The decision is set out.3. Finally, in Advice No 67. 142/AG given on 25 March 2020 on a proposal that the law of 27 March 2020 "grants the Koningom to take measures in the fight against the distribution of the Coronavirus COVID-13 (i ) "And the Act of 27 March 2020" that authorizes the king to take measures in the fight against the spread of the Coronavirus COVID-19 (II) "has given the legislation in this wording commentary on the possibility of the Executive to look for a legal basis, both integrated permissions and in a legal provision that grants the executive power special powers: "8. The mandatory ratification of all decisions taken on the basis of the pre -established scheme, even when this is from legal point of view is not strictly necessary. For example, it is possible that the King is taking measures or makes changes to regulatory provisions of animals on the basis of the ACTU legislation are part of its authority, but nevertheless provides legal basis in Article 5, § 1, of the proposal, for example because these associated with measures for which for which for which they must indeed appeal to the special powers or because the Specialteningswethem is allowed to ignore the provisions formal requirements. As a result of the reinforcement, obtaining or changed provisions of law determined or amended provisions. They can then be changed by means of a formal law. The king will no longer be able to change them, even if a specific provision authorizes him to take measures in this regard. In the past, the Council of State, the legislation department, has always advised against making changes to Special Female Decisions (2) ". Article6 of the draft decision aims at the amendment to Article 2 of the Decree of the Walloon Government of 18 March 2020 by the lifting of two sentences. This decree of 18 March 2020 has Article 33bis/2 of the Decree of 12, according to his April 2001 as a legal basis. It is not based on the decree of 17 March 2020 and is not numbered. It is therefore a common decision of the Walloon governmentIt is true that the change of the latter would not have established the difficulties in its advice No 67.142/AG by means of a decision of special powers, based on the decree of 17 March 2020, since the intention of two sentences of article 2 of the decision of 18 March 2020 to be canceled and not to add new provisions or to change existing provisions. While the change Vandeze would last by means of a decision of special powers, based on the decree of 17 March2020, do not cause the difficulties that the Legislation Division has stated in its Advice No 67.142/AG, since the intention is to levy two sentences of Article 2 of the Decree of 18 March 2020 and not to change them by adding or existing or existing to change provisions. From the point of view of legal certainty, however, it would be better to omit Article 6 of the design and huh t if necessary to approve autonomously. If the author of the draft the decision of 18 March 2020 wants to give the character of a decision of special powers, devoured content of the decision of 18 March 2020 must be included in a decision of special poweringat based on the decree of 17 March 2020, just like the draft decision. On this point, it must be reminded of more erosion that the draft that the decision of March 18 has not been brought to the legislation department. In this application for advice, the text in which the content of this decision is included a decision of special powers, also not brought to the legislation department. It is therefore not up to the legislation department to speak out. a new first paragraph is inserted, reading as follows: In view of the decree of 17 March2020 to the granting of special powers to the Walloon Government in the context of the Health Crisiscovid-19, Article 1; ". 2. Since the decrees of 12 April 2001 and December 19, 2002 No legal basis for the draft decision, they will not be stated in the preamble in the form of a lift reference, but they can be mentioned in the Considerans.3. In paragraph 7, in the French draft version, the words "22 Avril" replaced by the words "20 Mai" .4. Deconsider channels will be placed in the prospective after the support. The preamble will be referred to kel 2.1. In the first paragraph, in Defran's draft version, "30 Juin 2020" must be written instead of "30 Juin" .2. In Hetweede paragraph, "au plus tard à la Date Mentionnéeà l'Alinéa 1er" must be written in the French design version and the words "à l'ssue de Ladite période" must be replaced by the words "àcette date". 3. Since the draft text must have a legislative value on the basis of the Decree of 17 March 2020 by adding a support mechanism in which the decrees of 12 April 2001 and 19 -December 2002 do not provide for the possibility of, where appropriate any other provision with a regulatory character. Consequently, in Lid4, in the French draft version, the words "par Dérogation à l'Article 30ter de l'ruRêté relatif au marchéde l'électricité et à l'Article 33ter de l'r arrêté relatif au Marché du Gaz "omitted. A commercial comment applies to Article 3, third paragraph. Article 3. The reasons for the general comments and for greater clarity it is recommended, in the French design version, the words" à la fin de la pértiode visée à l'Article 1er, Alinéa 1er, the l'rocté Dugouvertigement Wallon du 18 Mars Portant Sur des Mesures Urgentes and Matière the compteur à budget "AUterme de la Période Allant du 18 Mars au 30 Juin 2020 »or by the words" après le 30 juin 2020 ".
