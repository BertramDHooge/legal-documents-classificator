Auf der Grundlage Dieser Befugnissehat der Regent Durch that Annahme von Article 9 Seines Voorerwähnten Erlasses Nr. 78 Vom 18. März 1831 article 114 des Voorerwähnten Gesetzes vom 28. June 1822, of that Legal Grund Bildet, Umgesetzt\"In the preliminary decision, it is also concluded that the minister of finances still has the authority to state the applications (complaints), the decree of tax surcharges, since in the case of the relevant case there is no cancellation or replacement of Article 9 of the above -mentioned decree no. 78 and the progressive replacement of the tax provided for by the predator June 28, 1822 by new taxes and the cancellation of the same law did not with the acceptance of norms that have legal force, or other higher norms, the grace authorization in the area of ​​tax law Sanctions to the Minister Derfinance are incompatible. However, this situation has recently changed by Article 3 of the Law Council 29, 2018, which aims at the assumption of a new legal standard, which is aimed at the transmission of ministerial authorization to enact or reduce tax surcharges and ADMI Nistroid tax benefit to the \"Office of Administration\", which was created during the service of tax settlement, but only for:- The income taxes,- the income taxes and taxes and taxes. Applicable in the area of ​​indirect taxes (with the exception of the various fees and taxes). The sake of the fact that the ministerial law is delegated to the director of VAT, registration and domain administration by a ministerial right to mercy by December 2, 1991 with the possibility that the possibility of To further reduce this right to the civil servants determined by him. This means that the minister of finance in terms of tax law money, VAT, registration fees and inheritance tax on the administrative delegation RT has, but retains an evocation right, since it is a delegation and not a transfer from powers. II. The issuance or reduction of tax surcharges and administrative money losses is the result of a decision of grace, namely a decision that is being caught independently of any legal dispute, has long been confused between great confusion between reducing taxes and on the other hand. This confusion is still reinforced by the fact that the same word \"reduction\" is used in the Dutch to translate the French words \"réduction\" (reduction) and \"modération\" (discount), whereby there are a reduction in partial limits. to apply that does not exceed the statutory maximum limit (200 percent), and dependent on the tax situation and the behavior of the taxpayers: i) type and severity of violation and II)) good or malicious. But the general advisor of the administration, with the determination of the administrative tax officer, checks on the basis of a complaint submitted by the taxpayer whether the 1992 (EStGB 92) and Article 225, 226 and 229/1 of the royal decree is carried out on the basis of Article 444 and 445 ESTGB 92 FES dated scales of the tax surcharges (i.e. H. of the staggered fines) and the administrative fines (i.e. the non -staggered benefit losses) are properly taken over in relation to the actual behavior of the tax liability. If the legal dispute if there is an administrative complaint, the judge will be presented with general responsibility; this means that this means that this means that this means that he can replace the contested decision of the management with his assessment. From a law, this means that he has the power to change the administrative decision submitted by the legal decision. In the event of a second time, it is by no means a second repository, with discounts (partial acquisition) of tax law money. in which a taxpayer would apply for the new check -up administrative penalty on the grounds that his tax situation would have been misjudged by the administrative authority or by the judge. Expensive laws that are submitted to the BVS are actually requests for mercy. Regardless of any legal and legal dispute, tax lenses will provide personal or financial situation that will no longer or can no longer pay you to pay the imposed tax rateAs a result, the question is no longer treated as to whether the tax rate is rightly or wrongly imposed, since this question has already been finally clarified in an earlier stage at an administrative or judicial complaint in which the request made previously submitted by the taxpay Namely, the reduction (possibly to zero) of the staggered or non -stagated tax law fine. The decision with which the taxpayer has been imposed on a tax fee fee is therefore not changed by the decision of the BVS, which finds a request for mercy; For reasons of equity (humanitarian, social, financial reasons, etc.), he brings a complete liberation or a partial exemption from the enforcement of the taxpayers imposed. Although the tax law sanction, namely the tax surcharge or the administrative fine, remains, but the tax administration no longer continues. tied together; This article brings the exemption from the enforcement of a part of the prison sentence to which a legal subjugate has been sentenced. or based on humanitarian and its good faith. This reason - and it is important to highlight this - can be submitted to the State Council for assessment by the citizens or companies in the application of Article 14 of the Coordinated Act. Mercimously, the group of those who suffer all sorts of setbacks, namely natural or legal persons whose financial possibilities to pay a imposed tax liability relationship to pay a imposed fine, deteriorates considerably and unwanted have, for example, as a result of a divorce, a life -threatening illness or bankruptcy or bankruptcy or an important customer, etc., the arguments are thoroughly checked by the arguments preferred by tax liability. On the basis of a report written by this office, the college of the tax settlement will take a decision. The law of July 29, 1991 On the express justification of the administrative acts, of course, is applicable to the applications to be made on the applications to be taken over in the area of ​​tax rates. Procedure for the administrative processing of applications for the decree of tax surcharges or tax law -lowering decreasing declining has been written on the basis of a logical question: Who, how, how and at whom will submit an application? In Article 1 of the draft decree, it is determined by who can. This article has been adapted to the remarks of the legislative department of the State Council, which is accepted in point 10 of the report No. 64.252/3 of October 11, 2018. Personal persons who are legally obliged to pay the tax liability for the total debt, for example, can submit an application for mercy: legal successors within the framework of an inheritance, complementary in simple limited partnerships or limited partnerships or limited partnerships of cooperatives with unlimited liability or open trading companies. for heads who have been sentenced by the company court for the total debt payment (the VAT or the preliminary vocational tax tax, since this joint and several liability on the main sum (the tax) and not on the Limited tax surcharges or fines. Administrative (complaint) and judicial (first instance, appeal and cassation)For tax law fines in the area of ​​the various fees and taxes - for which there is no administrative complaint procedure - an application for decree can only be submitted to the BVS if the general consultant service manager has private individuals, KMB or large companies about a reduction in fines. In the latter case, an application or reduction, which is always preceded by an administrative decision on the personal and financial situation of the taxpayer, must always be preceded by an earlier application for reducing fine on the personal and financial situation of the tax liability. . In this case, submission of applications is not associated with an exclusion period, but depends on the presence of a critical personal or financial situation on the part of the taxpayer, since the tax administration has already been finished due to the tax situation of the taxpayer. which will be submitted before January 1, 2019, the BVS will inform all those affected in writing about the amended law and regulation provisions. As far as possible, these applications are processed by the BVS, since their investigation is already completed or runs. As long as the college of the service tax settlement has not been submitted by an application submitted by the tax debtor, the application can be supplemented. are used. However, a specificity in relation to the usual examination, which is peculiar to the service that receives the submitted applications; Inarticula 3 paragraph 1 in FINE is provided that the FINDANANCE HR members of the Finanzin will include the investigation of the applications. Paragraph 1 of the draft decree submitted to the Council. To be able to take a thorough and comprehensive image of the files to be edited, the BVS employees must be able to fall back on the knowledge of the folisel officers who may be necessary to process the submitted applications. These officials are not used systematically, but only if this proves to be useful, for example when checking certain circumstances, such as the fulfillment of their tax obligations, for certain files in connection with and in the processing of files in connection with Reference to various taxes (e.g. VAT and income taxes) or files that require the use of various services (e.g. supporting and tax assessment). Objections based on regulations to avoid the validity of the resolutions for which such cooperation has been claimed. The BVS, in which the applications have to be submitted, is not obliged to examine these applications for grace under all circumstances alone and, if necessary General Administration Take and Contribution and the General Administration of Wealth Documentation. This was the case in the investigation of the same on the basis of Article 9 of the decree of the regent of March 18, 1831. Consulting tax surcharges regardless of the officials of the FöD can be organized if necessary on a collegial basis. Submit that is necessary when examining grace applications. In the rest, Article 3 of the draft decree is to those in points 12 and 13 of the expert opinion no. 64.252/3 of October 11, 2018 received comments from the legislative department of the State Council.The college of mercy -compensation from the college of the service of tax settlement 6 of the decree is to be recognized by the college of the tax settlement service, the function of the allocation authorization, whereupon the general administration takes and briefs the complete decree of the administrative penalty. Administrative complaints at the Administrative Department of State Council in the application of Article 14 § 1 of the coordinated laws on the Gent State Council appellation courtyard issued a fundamental decision on January 7, 2014 (No. 2013/AR/502) on the eventual application of Article 569 No. 32 of the Court of Justice , which enables a judicial complaint a ministerial decision, a complete decree or partial decree of a tax law sanction is rejected by the application of Article 9 of the Decree of March 1831. According to a thorough examination of the matter, the Court of Justice has rightly decided that decisions of Judges, which are dismissed by tax law requests, do not form a reason for a legal dispute in relation to the application of a tax law. Sen is indeed it indicates that the legal dispute brought before the judge as a legal dispute in relation to the application of a tax law (Article 569 No. 32 of the Court of Justice), but as a legal dispute in relation to the lawfulness of an administrative decision on the decree or the discount an administrative penalty should be considered. Such a legal dispute falls into the responsibility of the administrative dispute department of the State Council. Use of Article 14 of the coordinated laws of the State Council, an administrative debt is submitted to the State Council if no judicial complaint is possible. determined: \"Againstable administrative decision cannot be submitted to a judicial complaint.\" This provision has been inserted in order to inform everyone who submits an application for a request for grace, that no organized complaint is provided in the law of March 29, 2018, so that Article 14 § 1 The coordinated laws of the State Council can be applied. Elk resolutions of the jurisdiction of the court courts and courts are subject. Due to Article 145 and 160 of the constitution, this is an authority reserved for the legislator. Therefore, the relevant provisions must be deleted from the draft of a royal decree. The representative of the representative may be included in the report to the king, which is attached to the DESICHT. \"(Translation) These explanations were as follows:\" In the law, no organized complaint before court courts and courts is provided, Article 14 of the January 12th is on January 12th In 1973 laws coordinated by the State Council coordinated. In the text of the decree, it mentions that there is no organized judicial complaint, which means that the administrative dispute department of the State Council is responsible for a judge. \" Namely in the sense of a general character that it applies to all one -sided administrative acts of different administrative authorities, unless a special complaint options are provided for in the law before another case law. 6 of the law of March 29, 2018. Article 14 of the laws about the State Council coordinated on January 12, 1973. Mungin Article 8 of the Demstaatsrat presented was provided for a transitional determination with regard to applications for mercy, which was submitted before Chapter 2 of the Law of March 29, 2018 and the decree. Article 8 was as follows: \"Article 2 to 8 of the law of March 29, 2018 to expand the orders and to strengthen the role of the service of tax settlement and the determinant decree, apply to applications that are before the entry into force of Chapter 2 of the pre -mentioned law of March 29, 2018 in accordance with Article 9 of the Basic Recondition of the Regents of 18March 1831 The tax authorities have been submitted. In Deviation of Article 2, the receiving confirmation can be issued to the case mentioned in the previous paragraph until the first day of the second month after the date of the publication of the present decree. \"This article is deleted to point 15 of the expert opinion No. 64.252/3 of the legislative department of the State Council on October 11, 2018. In the time of the draft of the decree, about 650gnaden applications are pending. General of the general service levels about the amended law and prescription regulations in writing. The MPs must be presented by the minister of finances at the latest on June 30 of the year at the latest on June 30 of the year. Comments by the State Council on the points of the expert opinion no. 64.252/3 of the legislative department of the State Council is answered. But that regional taxes, the service of which do not guarantee the region, are subject to a concertification obligation that must be filled with the financing of the communities and regions on the basis of Article 5 §3 paragraph 1 of the special law on January 16, 1989. The Inarticula 9 of the draft presented to the State Council, namely November 1, 2018, could not be kept, the measure will only come into force on January 1, 2019 and can also affect any tax surcharges or fines that relate to the following :-Immobile Ien tax deduction in Wallonie,- Taxes on Games and Betting and on slot machine Brussels,- Traffic tax on motor vehicles and commissioning tax in Brussels (BUNSCIAL December 31, 2019). What concerns the property tax deduction, Article 444 of the EStGB92 is not applicable in the absence of an obligation to explain; In other words, tax complaints can be applied. The advance deduction is collected on the basis of the cable invocation determined by the general administration of the general administration and added directly to the defined assessment. In the event of non -payment or payment of payment, the intercession procedure is initiated and default interest is counted. Articles 445 of the EStGB 92 and Article 229/1 of the KE/EStGB 92 also do not apply in practice. In the area of ​​taxes on games and bets and on slot machines, an increase of 500 percent can be used for fraud or failure (Article 68 and 89 of the Legal Law into the income taxes (EStGStGB)). In the event of a violation of the closure or the ban, which is pronounced on the basis of Article 70 of the EStGStGB, a fine of EUR 250 to EUR 12,500 are imposed on Article 71 of the same. 2 of the law of March 29, 2018. What does the traffic tax affect motor vehicles and the commissioning tax concerns, the assumption of the tax by the Brussels capital region, which was originally planned for January 1, 2019, is postponed to January 1, 2020 This is determined in the area of ​​traffic tax on motor vehicles in Articles 40 and 41 of the Code of Law. The reared tax is increased three times if it exceeds a tenth of the original tax. The tax laid down by office must be paid immediately.In accordance with Article 41 of the same code of law, the court can collect the payment of the tax on the license plate of the relevant vehicle and its return to the Road Traffic Service - currently the management for vehicle registrations (DIV) of FöD Mobility and Transport system - from the information of the services of the General Administration (GVStW),, which are commissioned to coordinate the application of Article 9 of the enactment of the regent of March 18, 1831, it shows that a request for mercy has never been submitted with regard to any amount of money. Regions have not yet been transferred (inheritance tax and registration fee Brussels and in the Wallonia, certain fees in Flanders and taxes at the opening of barns for fermented drinks in Brussels), do not fall into the scope of Chapter 2 of the Lage of29. March 2018. The previous must, since there is no conflict of interest, no formal concerting procedure between the federal government and the regional governments. An interministerial conference \"Finance and Household\", which was made up of the affected regional and federal ministers or their representatives, have been requested. Opinion of data protection authority point 4 of the report No. 64.252/3 from October 11, 2018 The legislative department of the State Council stipulates that the statement of the data protection authority must be requested for the following reasons: \"In Article 36 (4) of the Ordinance (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons in the processing of personal data, free data traffic and the cancellation of the directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation), together with Article 57 paragraph 1 letter c) and with the Recording reason of this regulation read the obligation, the supervisory authority- in this case the data protection authority mentioned in the law of December 3, 2017 to create the data protection authority- in the development of a proposal for legislative measures to be issued by a national parliament or on such legislative measures that are based on such legislative measures Processing to consult. \" (Translation) The previous consultation of the supervisory authority, which is mentioned in Article 36 paragraph 4 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016, to which reference is made in point 4 of the above -mentioned report, concerns a future act that is in the context of Legislative measures to be issued from a national parliament or of such legislative measures -based regulatory measures. In addition, all requested applications for processing such files are already used internally. As a result, there is no increased risks that require special measures, since the data processing is available and neither your legal basis nor your basis for regulation is changed. The material task is no longer carried out by the responsible services of the GVStW, but by the BVS, which has been created the throughput 2 of the law of March 29, 2018 in the service of tax settlement, which is still subject to FöD finances, although it is autonomous Data protection of the FöD Finances obtained information also arises. The following is also made. Business of Chapter 2 Section 4 of the Law of August 3, 2012 to determine provisions in relation to the processing -related data by the Federation of Finance within the framework of his orders (BSVOM August 24, 2012) Can the federal public service finance \"which are aggregated in a data camp in accordance with Article 3, which enables the implementation of procedures in relation to data mining and data matching to carry out targeted controls on the one hand on the basis of risk indicators and on the other hand analyzes relational Data from various administrations and/or services of the federal public service to carry out finance \"(unofficial translation). The BVS is subordinate to the service of tax settlement and consequently also the FöD Finance. The aim of the above -mentioned legal determination is to be deleted.Due to the previous one, the statement of the data protection authority is required.III. Effect analysis when issuing the provisional report no. 64.252/3 of the legislative department of the State Council of October 11, 2018, has been taken into account in terms of the effects analysis when issuing regulations. State aid articles 107 paragraph 1 of the contract on the working method of the European Union (TFEU) is determined: \"Unless otherwise determined in the contracts, state or state -of -the -art subsidies are of any kind that are caused by the favoration of certain companies or production branches Falsify or falsify the competition, incompatible with the internal market, insofar as they affect the trade between Member States. \"In Article 107 paragraph 2 of the TFEU, what is compatible with the internal market is illustrated, for example: a) aid to individual consumers if they are granted without discrimination according to the origin of the goods, b) aid to the elimination of damage caused by natural disasters or other extraordinary events. (...) Diederzeit responsible services of the GVStW do not lead to any statistics, be it in relation to the amount of the enacted or reduced administrative penalty n, still in relation to the type of taxpayer (natural persons/companies). So now, it is impossible to say with certainty whether it is amounts \"of considerable amount\" or not. The reasons from which pardon can be granted are independent of tax. Rather, it will be social, family, financial or health reasons. In the case of companies that want to assert mercy law, it has to be a company that are in payment difficulties due to extraordinary circumstances. It is not distinguished either according to the type of company or the branch.

The goal was to support the most struck sectors. In the light of the changing economic situation, the demand for extra support for heavily affected economic factors has been raised. The Brussels Government has agreed to the granting of a compensation premium man 2,000 euros in support of entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises (between 0 and 5 VTEs) that are confronted with a significant decrease in their activity as a result of the measures taken the distribution of COVID- 19 to prevent. The budget for this measure is 102 million euros. The premium can in particular be granted to applicants with a location unit and personnel means of own goods on the territory of the Brussels -Capital Region (location unit registered at the Kruispuntbank of Enterprises). The premium is available for: 1а an independent company, natural person, who enjoys the full bridging right for March or April2020, that he was awarded the announcement of this decision; 2а a company whose managing manager will enjoy the full bridging right for March or April 2020, that he has the announcement of this decision was granted; 3а a company whose manager is not an independent requirement, if the majority (that is, more than half) of the employees temporarily unemployed ISin the framework of COVID-19 in March or April 2020; 4а an association if the majority of the employees are temporarily unemployed In the context of COVID-19 in March or April 2020. The support is only awarded to the same applicant once. The support cannot be cumulated with any other premium that is requested in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis from a region, a community or an institution of public utility that depends on one of these entities. It is therefore not possible to do this premium To cumulate with, in particular, the other premiums of the Brussels -Capital Region that are granted due to the crisis: flat -rate premium of 4,000 euros (special powers decision no. 2020/13 of 7 April 2020), premium for the social economy (Specealache Decree no. 2020/007 of 16 April 2020), Taxi premium (Special Powder Decree No 2020/16 of 7 May 2020), Premium for Agriculture and Aquaculture (Special Powder Decree No 2020/19 of 7 May2020), etc. The beneficiaries of the support are allowed are not a public company, nor does an enterprise of general interests, nor a company whose social goal is not of an economic nature, nor a company that is for r more than 50% is financed by the government. The above-mentioned limitation, include the category of potentiыle beneficiaries that are intended by this measure, so in particular:- the self-employed in business, including the free, medical and paramedical professions;- the associations whose social aim of Economicable is. Not all persons who work under the Statute of Self -employed, will therefore be entitled to the premiums, but only the self -employed in company who have a business number. To process the expected large number of applications facilitate, the intention is to work together with the National Institute for the Social Insurance of the Self -employed (RSVZ) and the Social Security Kruispuntbank, to obtain the data with regard to the awarded bridging rights and to be able to find out between the national number of Debegomde of the Bridging Law and the ON third -rate number of the self -employed person or the business that applies for the premium. This method should make faster processing possible and the premium on the basis of a statement is granted. With regard to temporary unemployment, the applicants will have to submit evidence that will be manually checked. Insertation of the advice of the Council of State of State, which was urgently consulted, has announced its comments in advice 67,422/1 of 25 May 2020. This Advice could not be added to this report because it is only available in a provisional, monolingual version. The findings of Dit Advies have given rise to changes to the DecreeFrom a combined reading of various provisions of Community law, the Council of State concludes that the advice of the Data Protection Authority should have been sought. This opinion is not shared. The first is the formulation of Article 57, first paragraph, c) of the General Regulation Data protection (AVG) not absolutely binding. Incidentally, it refers to the modalities laid down in the law of the Member State, which in particular Article 2, § 4, of the ordinance of 19 March 2020 to grant special features to the Brussels-Capital Government in the context of the Health Crisiscovid-13 . Article 36 (4) of the AVG must be read in conjunction with its first paragraph, that the following stipulates: `If a data protection effect assessment under Article 35 shows that the processing would lead a high risk if the controller does not take measures to limit the risk, Consult the controller prior to the processing supervisory authority. \" This high risk is not present in this case, all the more so since the data collected by Det administration is personal identification data that is not 'sensitive' data within the meaning of Article 9 of the AVG.The Data Protection Authority (GBA) confirms Datenkel `When it appears that the planned processing A high risk would lead to the controller-restrictive measures to take effective risk, the processing must be submitted in advance to the supervisory authority. If the risk can be sufficiently limited to the hand of appropriate technical and organizational measures, there must be a prior consultation place. For these various reasons and in view of the urgency, the advice of the GBA will not be requested. Subsequently, since the concept of 'enterprise', as defined in the first article, also includes 'self -employed in business', the Council of State orders the indication of the self -employed persons to delete the inscription. This recommendation has been followed. In the decision as the Council of State, the bridging right of the self -employed person was taken into account if the date of entry into force of the decision was paid. An objective of this clarification was prevented from the decision to ensure that self -employed persons request the bridging rights, not out of necessity, but with the intention of being able to enjoy this compensation premium. is quite short. Of course it is possible for several months to apply for this right for the months of March and April. However, it can be assumed that the person who needs support already served this application. Another important objective was a fast, semi -automatic processing of the premium applications possible to do, using the data from the RSVZ. In the absence of usage data, a manual processing of all applications would have been significantly told the payment of the premium. This would have reduced its relevance. The Council of State doubts whether the criterion of the payment of the bridging right sufficiently meets the requirement of equal treatment of self -employed people who enjoy the bridging right. He proposes to prefer a criterion of the grant of the bridging right. This suggestion has been followed. The Council Vanstate recalls that the constitutional right to protecting privacy implies that breaches of privacy must have a legal basis. That legal basis must report the categoryыn of personal data that will be processed in the implementation of the legislation.Arart8 has been rewritten by adding the list of category of personal data that BEW may collect in the context of the implementation of the scheme. As recommended by the The VANSTATE council has been omitted Article 8, § 1, second paragraph. In Article 9 of the draft situations are defined in which the premium cannot be granted and must be repaid. The Council of State is of the opinion that the formulation of the situations under 7аen 8а is not clear enough, in particular with regard to the mutual relationship between these two situations. The Council recommends not to display a situation under 7а as an example. In order to meet at the sake, the general reference to the conditions of Articles 3 and 4 has been deletedIt contained ambiguousness and was superfluous since Article 94 of the organic ordinance fan 23 February 2006 containing the provisions applicable to the budget, accounting and control applies to this premium, according to which the beneficiary `who does not comply with the conditions, including The subsidy was granted '`has been obliged to repay the subsidy'. The economic development of companies. He recommends, for the sake of clarity and the uniformity of the regulations, to refer to this chapter earlier and to take additional provisions in the Decree that are specific to the designed support regulation. This recommendation has not been followed. In the framework of the Implementation of the scheme in which a fixed premium of 4,000 euros is awarded, attempts to fraud have been established. In order to limit the risk of fraud, it was considered appropriate to explicitly mention the resources with which the premium applications are checked, but also of the possibility of imposing sanctions and the amount of those sanctions. For example, the decision provides for an administrative fine and its amount is included, which the Council of State has not discouraged. Article 12 of the draft stipulates that the officials of the officials who are competent for the audit have evidence to the contrary It has been proven. The Council of State recalls that the Constitutional Court is of the opinion that such a evidence of the general rule is that an official report counts as a mere information and therefore also of the rule of free proof of proof in criminal cases. He therefore requests the authors to see that this provision is compatible with the case law of the Constitutional Court. To meet this comment as well as possible, this evidence is reserved for the official reports on the infringements referred to in Article 14 . The official report with regard to the exclusions referred to in article 9 will therefore not have this character. It is important to retain this evidence for the official reports that relate to the infringements referred to in Article 14, since these types of disputes are often used \"the word of the applicant against that of the administration\", as the Council of State has rightly noted, the technical nature of the legislation in the proceedings makes it more difficult to determine the infringements. Finally, it must be noted that the regulations, and therefore the possibility of imposing administrative fines on the basis of this, has a temporary effect. The various improvements and corrections in the formulation of the decision proposed by the Council of State have also been implemented, as well as the proposal to abolish visas. Other improvements or corrections have been made in the formulation. Determination to Article 3, 2а, of the words `registered in the intersection bank of companies' form a technical clarification that has no consequences for the legal scope of the support regulation.inartic 3, 3а, Has the reference to the commercial character been deleted because the concept of 'commercial' is the rear given the cancellation of the Commercial Code as of November 1, 2018. This change does not have consequences for the scope of the provision.barbara traitestaatsecretary for economic transition_____nota1 https: // www. data protection authority.be/wanneer-een-voorgraander-admerging2020/030 of the Brussels-Capital Government on the support of companies that undergo a relapse of Hun activity as a result of the Health Crisis COVID-19DE Brussels-Capital Allocation, in view of the ordinance of 19 March 2020 to award special powers to the Brussels capital government in the context of the Health Crisis COVID-19, Article 2, §§1 and 3; Having regard to Article 2, § 3, 5а of the ordinance of 4 October 2018 to introduce the same juncture test; in view of the agreement of the Minister of Budget, given on 13 May 2020 ; In view of the urgency, motivated by the fact that the COVID-19 has health crisis appeals economic consequences for many companies; that there is urgent need for additional support for very small companies that are struggling with significant economic problems, to limit economic damage; The support provided for in this decision is to be a wave of bankruptcy and to be prevented among the very small companies and self-employed companies that considerably reduce their activities as a result of the crisis; that payment absence due to liquidity problems can lead to a domino effect on the economy, which should be avoided; that these problems and consequences will be felt in the very short term and that the implementation of the support measure should therefore not be delayed; that desteun must be able to be paid as quickly as possible and the urgency is therefore justified; in view of advice 67,422/1 of the Council of State, given on 25 May 2020, in application of Article 84, §1, first paragraph, 3а, of the laws on the Council of State, co -rdinated on January 12, 1973; predominantly the urgency of the urgency. or to consult the Economic and Social Council, as admitted on the basis of article 2, § 4, of the Ordon nantie of 19 March 2020 to the granting of special competences to the Brussels-Capital Government in the context of the health crisis COVID-19; - General provisions article 1.

Introductory of the COVID-19 Epidemia appeared in mid-March 2020, the federal government and governments of the communities and regions consults consultations committed with representatives of general practitioners and hospitals on Very short-term 'triage centers' to:-a massive non-organized intake of patients who are suspected of being sick to limit the hospital powers, whereby the triage centers have the task of assessing whether or not these patients in the hospital must be admitted (= \"triage function\");- to general practitioners to offer it to limit it with their patients who are suspected of wearing the virus to telephone contacts by referring to these 'triage centers' for a face-to-to -face medical examination;--in the available personal protective equipment can be concentrated in those places where patients, who may be infected by the virus, can be collected. At the end of the Epidemia, and on the The moment that the resources needed were proved to be sufficient to implement a large -scale screening policy, the triage centers were taxed with an extra assignment, after the decrease of samples at the persons to be screened (= `collection function '). The purpose of this protocol is to give more visibility to the provisions that have been agreed between the federal state and the sharing references regarding the modalities and conditions regarding the operation and finalance of the\" Triage and ADRAMENTRA \"and also to give an impetus to future agreements in which these centers can be embedded in a future regulatory framework.1. Two functions entrusted to the triage and purchase center. The triage fee service of the triage function is to prevent patients whose situation not a hospital admission requirement, registering to the hospital powder services. This function is intended for patient who have been referred by a general practitioner who has not performed a physical clinical examination and who suspects the symptoms are serious enough In order to justify a hospitalization. A clinical examination is carried out by a general practitioner, possibly assisted by nursing staff. The presence of a doctor is always necessary when the triage function is accessible. As a doctor after a clinical examination is of the opinion that a hospitalization is not necessary can, he can prescribe a test to the patient and carry out it in the triage and decrease center. B.The purchase feature function aims to better meet the needs of the population screening, it must make it possible to take care of the test question catch for e lke person who meets the criteria defined for the tests (1) and that is not included in a residential structure. The decision to test a patient is always taken by the treating (general) doctor, the test must prescribe to the patient before he /She is referred to the triage center. For citizens who do not have a general practitioner, a solution is provided by each general practitioner's circle. Up the reign function of the triage and purchase centers can also be invoked to perform certain tests at the request of the call centers set up in the context of the screening and follow-up strategy Persons who have been in close contact with others who have tested positivelyThese requests have to meet the recommendations approved by the Risk Management Group. In some cases, these requests can relate to asymptomatic persons, including people who have been placed in quarantine vinegar, who have not developed symptoms and who return to their work, causing them to contact risk groups. their patients to hospitalize (or to receive) patients to the triage and purchasing centers, conditions will still be determined after consultation with the general practitioner associations and the hospital umbrella organizations (or other umbrella organizations). The decrease can be carried out:- either by nursing staff or by a Doctor or by other competent health care providers. Defysical presence of a doctor is not mandatory, but the coordinating doctor will always have callable (for example, if a patient has more serious symptoms that require a clinical examination of whether a hospitalization is needed) .2. Accessibility of the triage and drop-off functioniesa. The trio function milk triage and purchase center establishes its triage function at a single location. To guarantee accessibility of the triage functions, the partialtities corresponds to the number of centers that started with at least 1 center shot of 100,000 inhabitants, retained (2). In regions where the number of centers is greater than 1 center per 100,000 inhabitants, the Deeltitieses will take the initiatives they consider useful to merge the centers that are the least inhabitants with a neighboring center. Triage functions organized in close collaboration with the emergency services of the hospitals . To this end, they make the necessary agreements that are requested for the governments. If the need for triage of patients for whom a face-to-face clinical examination is needed to assess the possible need for hospitalization, greatly reduced and the hospital powder service itself can itself be reduced by this position Perform, the triage function of the relevant center may be temporarily 'on hold' on condition of:- an explicit written agreement of one or more hospital powder service (s) that can/can/can take over the triage function- an accurate description of the conditions under which the triage and decrease center It will be asked to activate his triage function new. The triage and purchase center of which the triage function `On Hold 'has been set must be able to reactivate within 48 hours. As long as the triage function will remain active, it must be at least 4 hours a day and every weekday (working days) are accessible. Doors of availability of the triage function become clear from Student and communicated to the GPs The area that falls under the GP circle (s) that coordinate the function. A referral is organized (in a hospital, a waiting post or another triage center) when defunction is not available.b. The Award Function Function can be organized in Different locations on the territory of the circle (s) of general practitioners who organize the medical coordination of the Triage post, and this to increase the accessibility of the decline function. Different organization modes are possible (including mobile teams, Drive, ...). The times when the function is available at the different places where it is organized will be clearly stamped and announced to the GPs in the area and to the call center that taxes with the contact follow -up. At any location where the function becomes organized, this each day of the week will be accessible, with the possibility of referring patients through another location during the weekend (waiting post, different purchase function). The opening hours can be adjusted on the needs of the population and the workload, taking into account the evolution of the epidemic; they will always be at least one week are known in advance.3. Triage and drop-off centers are under the medical coordination of the GP circles placed medical coordination of triage and purchasing centers is entrusted to the GP circles that are recognized on the basis of either:- the Royal Decree of 8 July 2002 for determining the assignments granted to GPskingen-Het Decree of the Flemish Government of 26 June 2015 on the general practitioner circles. The medical coordination of a triage and purchase center can be insured by one general practitioner or a grouping of circlesThis circle (or grouping of circles) takes care of:- coordinating, in collaboration with the hospital powder services, of initiatives to organize the triage function within the territory that covers- coordinating initiatives to organize the purchase function at various locations within the territory that it covers- determining the opening hours of the different places where samples can be taken- further distribution to the different locations that offer the possibility of taking samples, of the protection and test material made available by the federal government; - Coordinating the allocation of staff (doctors, nurses, Technologists laboratory, administrative support, ...) to the various places of steel decrease;- to ensure that the triage and decrease centers comply with all information obligations to the government for qualitative and timely manner. This rich can be implemented in collaboration with a hospital. In this case, in a written agreement between the circle (s) of general practitioners, the hospital stipulates at least who bears the medical responsibility and the administrative responsibility of the triage and purchase center.4. Collaboration between triage and collection centers and laboratories for clinical biology sum to meet the exceptionally high need for test material and steel analysis, a federal platform has been temporarily established in addition to the traditional analysis circuits of the clinical biology. The two circuits are complementary, but are completely independent of each other. Each triage and purchase center is therefore requested either one or the other circuit. A combination of both is not permitted to avoid the risks of double financing. As the federal platform it is chosen, that platform will be responsible for the delivery of test material to the trium and purchase center, collecting the purchased tests, transporting them to its laboratories of the analysis results. The test material made available by the federal platform can under no circumstances be distributed to individual doctors who would then send these tests to a private or hospital laboratory. If the triage and decrease center chists chose to work with a hospital lab or private laboratory, Then this lab will take on the organization for the supply of the test material, for its collection and for the forwarding of deanalysis results. If at a certain point it appears that the initial laboratory can no longer meet the demand for analysis in the required period, in particular because the demand for analysis too Grootis, the triage and purchase center may ask to switch to the 'federal platform' The choice for the \"federal platform\" from the beginning or at a later time implies that the triage and decrease center from that moment continues to work exclusively with the federal platform as long as the total demand to test and laboratory analysis material the capacity that the traditional (private and private Whether hospital) can offer laboratories. The National Reference Center keeps supervision of the parameters that are necessary to measure whether or not this question exceeds regular capacities.5.CREAMENING and FINANCING OF THE TRIAGE AND ABOUTE CENTRA (general rules) a. Personal protection products with the triage and purchase center of personal protective equipment is organized and funded by the federal government. When distributing the protective equipment takes into account the population that can be operated by the triage and purchase center. A RIZIV intervention is foreseen for the costs that the triage and decrease centers have incurred that certain protective equipment were not available between March 16 and 4 May 2020. Deprecious organization within the Triage Center (eg creating any decentralization for the bias function) has no impact on the delivery of protection material. The triage and purchase center is considered by the government as a whole and is the only point of contact for material to deliver material. The center itself is responsible for the further distribution to its location of the needs. Awarding material materials for making the collection material on triage and purchasing centers depends on the 'laboratory circuit' chosen by the Center: either the federal platform or via a private or hospital laboratory. of the agreements with the federal platform or via the traditional repayment rules of the sickness and disability insurance.cFinancing the start-up costom The activity and time spent of the doctors who have participated in the establishment of the triage and purchase center during the period prior to the opening thereof, taking into account the loss of fees for regular activity, each center receives a maximum amount of EUR 7,230.60 that will be charged by the RIZIV (included in the R to KB No. 20). The amount to be deposited will be recorded through royal decisions will be determined into account the number of inhabitants and the number of participating GPs.d. Financing the medical government federal government comes through the RIZIV between in the financing of the medical coordination of the triage and decrease center, the reimbursement of the doctors and nurses the costs of the administrative support staff. The financing of the trio and reduction centers is regulated in the Royal Decree No. 20: Financing the doctors (Coordinati a clinical investigation), of the nurses and of the administrative support of this activity. For the period from 4 May 2020 (date on which the purchase function was added to the assignments of the triage and purchase centers), a Royal Decree will be drawn up that implements to Article 51 of the KB No. 20 that a flat -rate financing will be provided with the purchase function based on a quota of a maximum of 36 hours/day for the organization of medical activity by doctors and nurses. In function of the needs of the center (coordination, investigations and decreases) assesses the demedic and administrative manager the need for the use of doctors and nurses. For the number of hours of doctor, or a nurse, a fixed allowance will reimburse a rate of 80,34 euros or 47.25 euros per hour. In addition, a flat-rate allowance for the administrative support of 34.96 euros per hour (max. 12 hours per day) is provided. Deprestments of the hospital staff that are made available at the triage and purchase center will not be reimbursed for the double financing that from it will be reimbursed arises. The precise organization within the triage and purchase center (eg creating any decentralization for the deposit function) has no impact on the financing by health insurance. The center is considered a whole and is the only point of contact for the RIZIV.DIT Center Zigne must clearly indicate which the recognized care organization is that is responsible for the operation of the center, as well as the GP (s) that coordinates the center and the number of inhabitants within the region That covers the center.e. Intervention for the operating costs what the reimbursement of the operating costs concerns: each partentity establishes the conditions under which the oncoming costs of these centers are applied. The following general principles are applied:- Costs that are already reimbursed by a government cannot be charged; this; For example, applies to a number of operating costs of waiting items and hospitals if they make infrastructure or equipment available to the triage and decrease centers; - costs for protection material not be charged, for the federal government is made available;- no costs for computer science licenses may be imposed on the triage and purchasing centers in the framework of their obligations to register and to communicate with the clinical biology laboratories; In order to meet these obligations, free IT solutions will therefore be made available;- costs for use and maintenance of buildings of local open-up authorities will be charged from these public authorities on the basis of ad hoc consultation; Basis of these principles will determine each partentity the rules according to which it intervenes in the work costs of the triage and purchasing centers. If appropriate, a distinction is made between the period from 16 March to 3 May 2020 and the period that starts on 4 May, date on which the reduction function in the centers started. The principles and orientations adopted by the different part of entities are described below .6. Supply and financing of the triage and decrease centers (specific rules per sharing) a. In Flanders, Flemish Government Wil was committed to both the costs for the infrastructure, energy and utilities and non-medical enforcement costs via a fixed sumHowever, this package will not provide any coverage: -the personnel costs covered by the RIZIV personal protective equipment for which the federal government is responsible-amounts set by local authorities before 4 May 2020 in connection with IT licenses for the processing of the processing of the processing of the processing of the processing of The data in connection with ADMENTE Laboratory analyzes. The flat-rate intervention of the Flemish Government will be accompanied by measures to comply with the following principles- reduction in the number of triageing functions under closure or merger to 1/100,000 (approximately one per first-line zone)- installation of decentra in Sustainable locations Due to the processing of synergies between hospitals, waiting posts, local authorities and provinces organization of the centers, the organizational home doctors' government is approved always approves the locations with regard to the opening and closures is kept informed i.v.m. The satellite- no double financing provides (if federal financing is provided for infrastructure, eg via hospital or waiting post financing, then no financing will be provided from Flanders) .b. In Walloniëdewaalse Government undertakes to support the organization of the centers by intervening in the costs that are not covered by other authorities or other means, in terms of infrastructure, energy, public utilities and non-medical operating costs. EchtenGeen relate to:- the personnel costs covered by the RIZIV- personal protection products for which the federal government is responsible- amounts to any costs for the processing of data in connection with the purchase before 4 May 2020. samples and analysis result. The intervention of Wallonia will be accompanied by measures to meet the following principles: -the establishment of the centers at sustainable locations by creating synergies between hospitals, waiting posts, local authorities and provinces- an approval by the GPRENCRING ( and) over the organization of the centers prior approval by the Walloon government of the decision-making sites to open and close and to close information about what will happen with regard to the antennas- no double financing is planned (if a federal financing is already planned for infrastructure, for example via hospital - or guard item financing, there will be no financing from Wallonia) .c.c.c. in Brussels what the common community committee concerns, the means that are necessary to cover the operating costs of the triage and fall centers will be determined on the basis of the general plan \"test and Triage strategy \"that COCOM has been drawn up by COCOM in consultation with the FAMGB/FBHAV and the Hospital umbrella. .D.
