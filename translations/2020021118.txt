The statement of reasons is as follows: "This urgency is motivated by the fact that the Brussels -capital government urgently wants to safeguard legal certainty, both with regard to the extension of the deadlines and whatever the registration right at the establishment of a mortgage concerns. Due to the fact that the measures of "social distancing" are greatly hindering taxpayers in the implementation of certain obligations within the period foreseen, these periods must indeed be extended immediately so that the taxpayers concerned know with certainty that they will not be sanctioned.
