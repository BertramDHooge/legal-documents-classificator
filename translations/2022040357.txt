in the consideration that the Coronavirus Covid-19, which mostly resolves the lungs and the airways Insensely; that the Coronavirus Covid-19 is transferred from person to humans over the air; that the transmission of the disease apparently takes place to all possible distribution types; in the consideration that the royal decree of October 28, 2021, which is amended by the issue, contains three types of measures, namely urgent recommendations without criminal sanctions, minimum rules, which are to be observed in different locations or in differential sectors (or prevention measures that are adapted to every company in question, every association or every relevant service), and certain compulsory measures that are necessary in a limited number of areas;

that the rules of social distancing, in particular comply with a distance of 1.5 m between the persons; in the consideration that the wearing of a mask is an important role in the containment of the spread of the virus and in the protection of people in certain facilities and in the event of certain Activities plays; that there is therefore still compulsory in certain facilities and in certain activities; that wearing a mask in all situations in which the rules of social distancing cannot be met is also urgently recommended, except for the expressly intended exceptions; in the consideration that the RAG report of February 9, 2022 shows that the number the infections in the age group of 10 to 19 year olds are still particularly high, but the incidence in the age group of 0 to 9 year olds has decreased; that it is therefore possible to abolish the mask obligation for people in primary school system; in consideration that it shows from the same report that the age group of 10 to 19-year-olds are still required for precautionary measures; That the age, from which the mask requirement applies, continues to be at 12 years of being, in the consideration that in view of the considerable circulation of the virus in youth lights, a mask of interior of schools and educational institutions is necessary from the first secondary school year in order to use the presence lessons as far as to maintain as possible and at the same time limit the strong spread of the virus within this population group;

in the consideration that the risk of infection in the event of non -dynamic events in which The participants of the participants sit free or assigned places and move and interact little or calmly, is apparently obvious; that this risk in dynamic events in which the participants can remain less off or move to z. B. to dance, but is higher; That the fact that an event takes place or outdoors is not the only relevant criterion for the assessment of risk degrees of these events; and not moving, apparently less; The fact that it is justified in this regard to allow one-higher occupancy for this type of horeca jobs as well as for Horeca activities that take place outdoors; -Code take place; in the consideration that events in view of the health situation are still necessary for events to take measures to take the number of participants in (large) events in both interior and outdoors;

That more than 200 people may be received if the number of people received from the capacity of the Capacity of the place where dynamic events take place in interiors, and 80 percent of the capacity of the place where non -dynamic events take place and outdoor events ; That in certain cases 100 percent of the capacity may be used, especially if the guide value for the interior air quality can be observed or if a layout into blocks or additional anti-crowding measures (control of crowds) in the open space)The fact that the capacity restrictions therefore do not apply to events with 200 or fewer people and the capacity of 200 people is therefore always guaranteed, regardless of the result of the air quality measurements; in the consideration that it is not possible under certain circumstances to comply with the conditions with regard to the distribution into blocks ; that in this case the local authorities can decide on the basis of additional anti-crowding measures that security still ensures sufficiently; that these measures can affect the avoidance of crowds both at the place of the event as well as the surrounding area of ​​this place and in relation to the associated means of transport; that in the event of such a decision the capacity restrictions do not apply;

may gather limited number of people to avoid infection; that this restriction is justified in view of the imaginary recurring nature of these activities; That it is therefore justified in view of the Grand Number of this kind of limiting the number of people who collect on these occasions to groups of 200 people in interiors;

that the number of occupied hospital beds must be further reduced; that it must be prevented that it remains at such a high level that a increase in renewal, for example as a result of new variantsImmediately lead to an overload of the health care system; in the consideration that the speed at which new variants can be spread in Belgium is influenced by virus circulation; that effective measures are still required in order to reduce the effects of viral circulation and to make them more controllable; in the consideration that measures to protect the population and to reduce pressure are still necessary for the health care system, including primary care; the RAG of February 9, 2022, in which it is found that the country is still in the highest epidemiological alarm level; in consideration that the same report shows that the RAG is further improved by the health situation and the number of hospital admissions and in The intensive care of the intensive care units awaits that enable the threshold values ​​for the transition to a new phase of the barometer in the second half of February; that these threshold values ​​correspond to a transition to the phase of the above-mentioned barometer; inner consideration of the health risk for the population and the urgency that arises from the Coronavirus Covid-19; in the consideration that the Coronavirus Covid-19, which mostly resolves the lungs and the airways Insensely; that the Coronavirus Covid-19 is transferred from person to humans over the air; that the transmission of the disease apparently takes place to all possible distribution types; in the consideration that the royal decree of October 28, 2021, which is amended by the issue, contains three types of measures, namely urgent recommendations without criminal sanctions, minimum rules, which are to be observed in different locations or in differential sectors (or prevention measures that are adapted to every company in question, every association or every relevant service), and certain compulsory measures that are necessary in a limited number of areas; in the consideration that the Hygiene measures remain, for example, the special attention of the hygiene measures in sneezing and cough, hand hygiene and disinfection of the material used; in the consideration that with regard to compliance with all health recommendations and social distancing d the solidarity of every citizen is appealed; that the rules of social distancing, in particular comply with a distance of 1.5 m between the persons; in the consideration that the wearing of a mask is an important role in the containment of the spread of the virus and in the protection of people in certain facilities and in the event of certain Activities plays; that there is therefore still compulsory in certain facilities and in certain activities; that wearing a mask in all situations in which the rules of social distancing cannot be met is also urgently recommended, except for the expressly intended exceptions; in the consideration that the RAG report of February 9, 2022 shows that the number the infections in the age group of 10 to 19 year olds are still particularly high, but the incidence in the age group of 0 to 9 year olds has decreased; that it is therefore possible to abolish the mask obligation for people in primary school system; in consideration that it shows from the same report that the age group of 10 to 19-year-olds are still required for precautionary measures; That the age, from which the mask requirement applies, continues to be at 12 years of being, in the consideration that in view of the considerable circulation of the virus in youth lights, a mask of interior of schools and educational institutions is necessary from the first secondary school year in order to use the presence lessons as far as to maintain as possible and at the same time limit the strong spread of the virus within this population group; that the communities -specific conditions in relation to exceptional circumstances can be determined under which the diemask obligation does not apply; that this measure was taken into account at the request of the communities and in consultation, taking into account the principle of federal loyalty; that the measure is necessary in view of the previous and proportionate in relation to the pursuing goal, namely to combat the spread of the virus and ensure maintaining the presence lesson; and certain restrictions are subject toto maintain the fundamental right to the life and health of the population; that activities in the free room should be preferred; that it is recommended to avoid intensive contacts; that, on the contrary, the rooms have to be ventilated and ventilated sufficiently; that the opinion of the Gemsvom shows December 21, 2021 that events with larger crowds in which the hygiene measures and the rules of social distancing are not adhered to are associated with risks; in the consideration that the risk of infection in the event of non -dynamic events in which The participants of the participants sit free or assigned places and move and interact little or calmly, is apparently obvious; that this risk in dynamic events in which the participants can remain less off or move to z. B. to dance, but is higher; That the fact that an event takes place or outdoors is not the only relevant criterion for the assessment of risk degrees of these events; and not moving, apparently less; The fact that it is justified in this regard to allow one-higher occupancy for this type of horeca jobs as well as for Horeca activities that take place outdoors; -Code take place; in the consideration that events in view of the health situation are still necessary for events to take measures to take the number of participants in (large) events in both interior and outdoors; that the current favorable development of the epidemic Situation enables dynamic event to allow interiors again; that these events must take place with strict compliance with the proposed measures or the protocols; that this has been confirmed several times in the GEMS report; that it is particularly difficult with dynamic events to comply with the rules of social distancing and the mask obligation; that many aerosols can spread inside the interior of the facilities in which such event relates can therefore spread; that there is therefore a stricter capacity restriction during such events due to the higher risk compared to other types of events; that this stricter measure, as long as the health situation has not really improved, is therefore necessary to protect the fundamental right to the life and health of the population; In the consideration that the rules for publicly accessible events and private events in view of the introduction of new criteria may now be similar with a few exceptions, since the difference between the epidemiological effects of these situations is only slight; that these exceptions on the one hand, on the one hand, are based on the fundamental rights, such as the right to maintain private life and the right -wing protection of personal data, and on the other hand through the inappropriateness of certain rules of certain rules for privacy events; which represent a higher risk and non -dynamic events that pose a lower risk, the development of the health situation enables a loosening of certain measures to refer to events; that when limiting the number of people present in events, the capacity of the location where the event takes place must be taken into account; That more than 200 people may be received if the number of people received from the capacity of the Capacity of the place where dynamic events take place in interiors, and 80 percent of the capacity of the place where non -dynamic events take place and outdoor events ; that in certain cases 100 percent of the capacity may be used, especially if the guide value for interior air quality can be observed or if a layout into blocks or additional anti-crowding measures (control of crowds) in the open space; The fact that the capacity restrictions therefore do not apply to events with 200 or fewer people and the capacity of 200 people is therefore always guaranteed, regardless of the result of the air quality measurements; in the consideration that it is not possible under certain circumstances to comply with the conditions with regard to the distribution into blocks ; that in this case the local authorities can decide on the basis of additional anti-crowding measuresthat the security is still sufficiently guaranteed; that these measures can affect the avoidance of crowds both at the place of the event as well as the surrounding area of ​​this place and in relation to the associated means of transport; that in the event of such a decision the capacity restrictions do not apply; in consideration of the lower risk of events that take place, and the favorable development of the epidemiological situation, the mask obligation no longer applies to participants in such events; that this obligation continues to apply to employees and organizers of events, as is intended for the personnel during the commercial exercise of Horeca activities; Indian Raising that with regard to respect for private life, private events that take place at home or in tourist accommodation are not subject to any restrictions; in the consideration that organizers are responsible for the control of the crowd; D; Ass the local authorities are requested to monitor compliance with the strictness of measures applicable to events; that these events cannot take place if these measures cannot be kept; in the consideration that in the pursuit of coherence film screenings inkinos and congresses in view of the number of people who come together must correspond to the rules applicable to events; that the rules for congresses, depending on whether they are organized dynamically or not dynamically, therefore differ, just as for the other events; that in the collaboration agreement from July 14, 2021 it is planned that the rules for the application of the Covid Safe tickets, including cinemas and at congresses, are determined by the federated sub -areas; may gather limited number of people to avoid infection; that this restriction is justified in view of the imaginary recurring nature of these activities; That it is therefore justified in view of the Grand Number of this kind of limiting the number of people who collect on these occasions to groups of 200 people in interiors; that the applicable protocols must be held; that participants can be accompanied by two adults up to the age of 17, including and needy participants; that these two personal perspectives have been included in the maximum number; in consideration that sporting activities contribute to the spiritual and physical health of the individual; that this is not the case for these activities for these activities of approved persons in relation to organized activities; However, the fact that this high number of sports camps applies, which are treated in the same way as cultural and youth camps; However, it is strongly recommended to exercise group and contact sport as often as possible; in the consideration that the gradual cancellation of the restrictions for Horeca activities can also be continued, in particular the restrictions on the opening and closing times of the facilities of this sector, the Number of people who are allowed to sit together at one table, the obligation to remain sitting, and the mask obligation; in consideration that loosening was provided for the previously mentioned facilities in relation to the ban on the practice of commercial exercises between midnight and 5:00 a.m. are; that it is more recently that the same loosening is also intended for night shops; in the consideration that these loosening should also go hand in hand due to the favorable epidemiological situation, that in companies that have been consumers or services that offer restrictions in reference to social distancing, Group size and number of people who should be resolved in their rooms, especially in shops and shopping centers; that the size of the groups that visit the markets should no longer be limited; in the consideration that terraces or tents must meet several conditions in order to apply than outdoors or outdoors in the sense of this decree; that in both cases the air must be able to circulate free; that in cases in which these criteria are not met, these premises are located indoors or in interior areas; in the consideration that the use of air quality measuring devices (CO2) is still necessary in order to use the infection risks in the interiors of certain facilities Protects, especially in the restaurants and taps of the hotel and restaurant industry, including discos and dance locationsthe institutions of the sports sector, the infrastructures in which certain gross events take place, the cinemas and the facilities of the event sector, since due to the activities there, the spread of aerosols can be particularly high; that the air quality provisions apply to these institutions if, for example, private events, publicly accessible events or organized activities take place there; in consideration that in view of the health situation and to ensure the coherence of the applicable measures, discotheques and dance halls can be reopened; that access to discos and dance restaurants must in any case have to be organized in accordance with the modalities of the above work agreement of July 14, 2021; that this institutions comply with the Horeca rules in relation to their regular services; in the consideration that the report of the GEMS of February 10, 2022 shows that reservation of health measures in the workplace can be lifted the mandatory work in the home office be able; However, that it is still recommended to limit the presence at the workplace in order to limit contacts between people in the work environment and to reduce the number of people who use public transport at peak times; in consideration that it is recommended to be recommended to the number of contacts Reducing and using self -tests for gatherings or meetings; that the use of self -testing is useful to determine infection in good time and to prevent the spread of the virus; in the consideration that in the maximum number of people who may come together, the terms of children are also always specifically determined; in the Ravery that the recommendation (EU) 2022/107 of the Council of January 25, 2022 for a coordinated procedure to make it easier to exercise freedom during the Covid 19 pandemic and to replace the recommendation (EU) 2020/1475 A personal-based approach for travel While the COVID-19 pandemy advocates, what is used that the vaccination, test or recovery status of the traveler should be rash; that such a approach simplifies the applicable regulations and offers travelers more clarity and predictability; that people from the age of 12 who travel from another country to Belgium and do not have their main residence in Belgium have a vaccine, test or recovery certificate that exceptions must be maintained, among other things, to hinder trips within the framework of everyday life in border areas; in the consideration that to facilitate freedom of movement within Dereu, standardized validity periods and accepted types of tests that are at EU level should be determined; that it is also important for this reason to maintain the standardized period of validity of the first vaccination series and the unlimited validity of the refresher dose at the EU level; that it is also important for the same reason to maintain the standardized permanent period of the recovery certificate; in the consideration that the international traffic transport can lead to the spread of well -known and unknown variants of the virus and therefore requires a ashoption of monitoring of the adopted health regulations; that certain people still have to have a vaccination certificate in order not to be allowed to travel to Belgium as part of the framework; that such certificates show that a person against the Coronavirus Covid-13 is possible, which enables safer passenger traffic; in the consideration that a Passenger Locator form (PLF) is still filled out to be adequate monitoring and tracking travelers; that these documents serve as the basis in order to ensure the necessary contact and health monitoring by the responsible services if necessary; that this form must be filled in electronically in order to avoid in particular that there is a delay in the preservation of one-time codes for a PCR test and the necessary notification via the health measures to be followed; that the carrier is obliged to check whether all passengers have filled out the electronic version of the PLF before joining; that the airport operator must also check this on the arrival of the state;

that these threshold values ​​correspond to a transition to the phase of the above-mentioned barometer; inner consideration of the health risk for the population and the urgency that arises from the Coronavirus Covid-19; in the consideration that the Coronavirus Covid-19, which mostly resolves the lungs and the airways Insensely; that the Coronavirus Covid-19 is transferred from person to humans over the air; that the transmission of the disease apparently takes place to all possible distribution types; in the consideration that the royal decree of October 28, 2021, which is amended by the issue, contains three types of measures, namely urgent recommendations without criminal sanctions, minimum rules, which are to be observed in different locations or in differential sectors (or prevention measures that are adapted to every company in question, every association or every relevant service), and certain compulsory measures that are necessary in a limited number of areas; in the consideration that the Hygiene measures remain, for example, the special attention of the hygiene measures in sneezing and cough, hand hygiene and disinfection of the material used; in the consideration that with regard to compliance with all health recommendations and social distancing d the solidarity of every citizen is appealed; that the rules of social distancing, in particular comply with a distance of 1.5 m between the persons; in the consideration that the wearing of a mask is an important role in the containment of the spread of the virus and in the protection of people in certain facilities and in the event of certain Activities plays; that there is therefore still compulsory in certain facilities and in certain activities; that wearing a mask in all situations in which the rules of social distancing cannot be met is also urgently recommended, except for the expressly intended exceptions; in the consideration that the RAG report of February 9, 2022 shows that the number the infections in the age group of 10 to 19 year olds are still particularly high, but the incidence in the age group of 0 to 9 year olds has decreased; that it is therefore possible to abolish the mask obligation for people in primary school system; in consideration that it shows from the same report that the age group of 10 to 19-year-olds are still required for precautionary measures; That the age, from which the mask requirement applies, continues to be at 12 years of being, in the consideration that in view of the considerable circulation of the virus in youth lights, a mask of interior of schools and educational institutions is necessary from the first secondary school year in order to use the presence lessons as far as to maintain as possible and at the same time limit the strong spread of the virus within this population group; that the communities -specific conditions in relation to exceptional circumstances can be determined under which the diemask obligation does not apply; that this measure was taken into account at the request of the communities and in consultation, taking into account the principle of federal loyalty; that the measure is necessary in view of the previous and proportionate in relation to the pursuing goal, namely to combat the spread of the virus and ensure maintaining the presence lesson; and certain restrictions are subject toto maintain the fundamental right to the life and health of the population;

in the consideration that the risk of infection in the event of non -dynamic events in which The participants of the participants sit free or assigned places and move and interact little or calmly, is apparently obvious; that this risk in dynamic events in which the participants can remain less off or move to z. B. to dance, but is higher; That the fact that an event takes place or outdoors is not the only relevant criterion for the assessment of risk degrees of these events; and not moving, apparently less; The fact that it is justified in this regard to allow one-higher occupancy for this type of horeca jobs as well as for Horeca activities that take place outdoors; -Code take place; in the consideration that events in view of the health situation are still necessary for events to take measures to take the number of participants in (large) events in both interior and outdoors;

that this has been confirmed several times in the GEMS report; that it is particularly difficult with dynamic events to comply with the rules of social distancing and the mask obligation; that many aerosols can spread inside the interior of the facilities in which such event relates can therefore spread; that there is therefore a stricter capacity restriction during such events due to the higher risk compared to other types of events; that this stricter measure, as long as the health situation has not really improved, is therefore necessary to protect the fundamental right to the life and health of the population; In the consideration that the rules for publicly accessible events and private events in view of the introduction of new criteria may now be similar with a few exceptions, since the difference between the epidemiological effects of these situations is only slight; that these exceptions on the one hand, on the one hand, are based on the fundamental rights, such as the right to maintain private life and the right -wing protection of personal data, and on the other hand through the inappropriateness of certain rules of certain rules for privacy events; which represent a higher risk and non -dynamic events that pose a lower risk, the development of the health situation enables a loosening of certain measures to refer to events; that when limiting the number of people present in events, the capacity of the location where the event takes place must be taken into account; That more than 200 people may be received if the number of people received from the capacity of the Capacity of the place where dynamic events take place in interiors, and 80 percent of the capacity of the place where non -dynamic events take place and outdoor events ; that in certain cases 100 percent of the capacity may be used, especially if the guide value for interior air quality can be observed or if a layout into blocks or additional anti-crowding measures (control of crowds) in the open space; The fact that the capacity restrictions therefore do not apply to events with 200 or fewer people and the capacity of 200 people is therefore always guaranteed, regardless of the result of the air quality measurements; in the consideration that it is not possible under certain circumstances to comply with the conditions with regard to the distribution into blocks ; that in this case the local authorities can decide on the basis of additional anti-crowding measuresthat the security is still sufficiently guaranteed; that these measures can affect the avoidance of crowds both at the place of the event as well as the surrounding area of ​​this place and in relation to the associated means of transport; that in the event of such a decision the capacity restrictions do not apply;

may gather limited number of people to avoid infection; that this restriction is justified in view of the imaginary recurring nature of these activities; That it is therefore justified in view of the Grand Number of this kind of limiting the number of people who collect on these occasions to groups of 200 people in interiors;

in consideration that loosening was provided for the previously mentioned facilities in relation to the ban on the practice of commercial exercises between midnight and 5:00 a.m. are; that it is more recently that the same loosening is also intended for night shops;

the RAG of February 9, 2022, in which it is found that the country is still in the highest epidemiological alarm level; in consideration that the same report shows that the RAG is further improved by the health situation and the number of hospital admissions and in The intensive care of the intensive care units awaits that enable the threshold values ​​for the transition to a new phase of the barometer in the second half of February; that these threshold values ​​correspond to a transition to the phase of the above-mentioned barometer; inner consideration of the health risk for the population and the urgency that arises from the Coronavirus Covid-19; in the consideration that the Coronavirus Covid-19, which mostly resolves the lungs and the airways Insensely; that the Coronavirus Covid-19 is transferred from person to humans over the air; that the transmission of the disease apparently takes place to all possible distribution types; in the consideration that the royal decree of October 28, 2021, which is amended by the issue, contains three types of measures, namely urgent recommendations without criminal sanctions, minimum rules, which are to be observed in different locations or in differential sectors (or prevention measures that are adapted to every company in question, every association or every relevant service), and certain compulsory measures that are necessary in a limited number of areas; in the consideration that the Hygiene measures remain, for example, the special attention of the hygiene measures in sneezing and cough, hand hygiene and disinfection of the material used; in the consideration that with regard to compliance with all health recommendations and social distancing d the solidarity of every citizen is appealed; that the rules of social distancing, in particular comply with a distance of 1.5 m between the persons; in the consideration that the wearing of a mask is an important role in the containment of the spread of the virus and in the protection of people in certain facilities and in the event of certain Activities plays; that there is therefore still compulsory in certain facilities and in certain activities; that wearing a mask in all situations in which the rules of social distancing cannot be met is also urgently recommended, except for the expressly intended exceptions; in the consideration that the RAG report of February 9, 2022 shows that the number the infections in the age group of 10 to 19 year olds are still particularly high, but the incidence in the age group of 0 to 9 year olds has decreased; that it is therefore possible to abolish the mask obligation for people in primary school system; in consideration that it shows from the same report that the age group of 10 to 19-year-olds are still required for precautionary measures; That the age, from which the mask requirement applies, continues to be at 12 years of being, in the consideration that in view of the considerable circulation of the virus in youth lights, a mask of interior of schools and educational institutions is necessary from the first secondary school year in order to use the presence lessons as far as to maintain as possible and at the same time limit the strong spread of the virus within this population group; that the communities -specific conditions in relation to exceptional circumstances can be determined under which the diemask obligation does not apply; that this measure was included in the decree at the request of the communities and in consultation in compliance with the principle of federal loyaltythat the measure is necessary in view of the previous and proportionate in relation to the pursuing goal, namely to combat the spread of the virus and ensure maintaining the presence lesson; and certain restrictions are subject to maintaining the fundamental right to the life and health of the population; that activities in the free room should be preferred; that it is recommended to avoid intensive contacts; that, on the contrary, the rooms have to be ventilated and ventilated sufficiently; that the opinion of the Gemsvom shows December 21, 2021 that events with larger crowds in which the hygiene measures and the rules of social distancing are not adhered to are associated with risks; in the consideration that the risk of infection in the event of non -dynamic events in which The participants of the participants sit free or assigned places and move and interact little or calmly, is apparently obvious; that this risk in dynamic events in which the participants can remain less off or move to z. B. to dance, but is higher; That the fact that an event takes place or outdoors is not the only relevant criterion for the assessment of risk degrees of these events; and not moving, apparently less; The fact that it is justified in this regard to allow one-higher occupancy for this type of horeca jobs as well as for Horeca activities that take place outdoors; -Code take place; in the consideration that events in view of the health situation are still necessary for events to take measures to take the number of participants in (large) events in both interior and outdoors; that the current favorable development of the epidemic Situation enables dynamic event to allow interiors again; that these events must take place with strict compliance with the proposed measures or the protocols; that this has been confirmed several times in the GEMS report; that it is particularly difficult with dynamic events to comply with the rules of social distancing and the mask obligation; that many aerosols can spread inside the interior of the facilities in which such event relates can therefore spread; that there is therefore a stricter capacity restriction during such events due to the higher risk compared to other types of events; that this stricter measure, as long as the health situation has not really improved, is therefore necessary to protect the fundamental right to the life and health of the population; In the consideration that the rules for publicly accessible events and private events in view of the introduction of new criteria may now be similar with a few exceptions, since the difference between the epidemiological effects of these situations is only slight; that these exceptions on the one hand, on the one hand, are based on the fundamental rights, such as the right to maintain private life and the right -wing protection of personal data, and on the other hand through the inappropriateness of certain rules of certain rules for privacy events; which represent a higher risk and non -dynamic events that pose a lower risk, the development of the health situation enables a loosening of certain measures to refer to events; that when limiting the number of people present in events, the capacity of the location where the event takes place must be taken into account; That more than 200 people may be received if the number of people received from the capacity of the Capacity of the place where dynamic events take place in interiors, and 80 percent of the capacity of the place where non -dynamic events take place and outdoor events ; That in certain cases 100 percent of the capacity may be used, especially if the guide value for the interior air quality can be observed or if a layout into blocks or additional anti-crowding measures (control of crowds) in the open space)The fact that the capacity restrictions therefore do not apply to events with 200 or fewer people and the capacity of 200 people is therefore always guaranteed, regardless of the result of the air quality measurements; in the consideration that it is not possible under certain circumstances to comply with the conditions with regard to the distribution into blocks ; that in this case the local authorities can decide on the basis of additional anti-crowding measures that security still ensures sufficiently; that these measures can affect the avoidance of crowds both at the place of the event as well as the surrounding area of ​​this place and in relation to the associated means of transport; that in the event of such a decision the capacity restrictions do not apply; in consideration of the lower risk of events that take place, and the favorable development of the epidemiological situation, the mask obligation no longer applies to participants in such events; that this obligation continues to apply to employees and organizers of events, as is intended for the personnel during the commercial exercise of Horeca activities; Indian Raising that with regard to respect for private life, private events that take place at home or in tourist accommodation are not subject to any restrictions; in the consideration that organizers are responsible for the control of the crowd; D; Ass the local authorities are requested to monitor compliance with the strictness of measures applicable to events; that these events cannot take place if these measures cannot be kept; in the consideration that in the pursuit of coherence film screenings inkinos and congresses in view of the number of people who come together must correspond to the rules applicable to events; that the rules for congresses, depending on whether they are organized dynamically or not dynamically, therefore differ, just as for the other events; that in the collaboration agreement from July 14, 2021 it is planned that the rules for the application of the Covid Safe tickets, including cinemas and at congresses, are determined by the federated sub -areas; may gather limited number of people to avoid infection; that this restriction is justified in view of the imaginary recurring nature of these activities; That it is therefore justified in view of the Grand Number of this kind of limiting the number of people who collect on these occasions to groups of 200 people in interiors; that the applicable protocols must be held; that participants can be accompanied by two adults up to the age of 17, including and needy participants; that these two personal perspectives have been included in the maximum number;

in the consideration that the Coronavirus Covid-19, which mostly resolves the lungs and the airways Insensely; that the Coronavirus Covid-19 is transferred from person to humans over the air; that the transmission of the disease apparently takes place to all possible distribution types; in the consideration that the royal decree of October 28, 2021, which is amended by the issue, contains three types of measures, namely urgent recommendations without criminal sanctions, minimum rules, which are to be observed in different locations or in differential sectors (or prevention measures that are adapted to every company in question, every association or every relevant service), and certain compulsory measures that are necessary in a limited number of areas; in the consideration that the Hygiene measures remain, for example, the special attention of the hygiene measures in sneezing and cough, hand hygiene and disinfection of the material used; in the consideration that with regard to compliance with all health recommendations and social distancing d the solidarity of every citizen is appealed; that the rules of social distancing, in particular comply with a distance of 1.5 m between the persons; in the consideration that the wearing of a mask is an important role in the containment of the spread of the virus and in the protection of people in certain facilities and in the event of certain Activities plays; that there is therefore still compulsory in certain facilities and in certain activities; that wearing a mask in all situations in which the rules of social distancing cannot be met is also urgently recommended, except for the expressly intended exceptions; in the consideration that the RAG report of February 9, 2022 shows that the number the infections in the age group of 10 to 19 year olds are still particularly high, but the incidence in the age group of 0 to 9 year olds has decreased; that it is therefore possible to abolish the mask obligation for people in primary school system; in consideration that it shows from the same report that the age group of 10 to 19-year-olds are still required for precautionary measures; That the age, from which the mask requirement applies, continues to be at 12 years of being, in the consideration that in view of the considerable circulation of the virus in youth lights, a mask of interior of schools and educational institutions is necessary from the first secondary school year in order to use the presence lessons as far as to maintain as possible and at the same time limit the strong spread of the virus within this population group; that the communities -specific conditions in relation to exceptional circumstances can be determined under which the diemask obligation does not apply; that this measure was taken into account at the request of the communities and in consultation, taking into account the principle of federal loyalty; that the measure is necessary in view of the previous and proportionate in relation to the pursuing goal, namely to combat the spread of the virus and ensure maintaining the presence lesson; and certain restrictions are subject toto maintain the fundamental right to the life and health of the population; that activities in the free room should be preferred; that it is recommended to avoid intensive contacts; that, on the contrary, the rooms have to be ventilated and ventilated sufficiently; that the opinion of the Gemsvom shows December 21, 2021 that events with larger crowds in which the hygiene measures and the rules of social distancing are not adhered to are associated with risks; in the consideration that the risk of infection in the event of non -dynamic events in which The participants of the participants sit free or assigned places and move and interact little or calmly, is apparently obvious; that this risk in dynamic events in which the participants can remain less off or move to z. B. to dance, but is higher; That the fact that an event takes place or outdoors is not the only relevant criterion for the assessment of risk degrees of these events; and not moving, apparently less; The fact that it is justified in this regard to allow one-higher occupancy for this type of horeca jobs as well as for Horeca activities that take place outdoors; -Code take place; in the consideration that events in view of the health situation are still necessary for events to take measures to take the number of participants in (large) events in both interior and outdoors; that the current favorable development of the epidemic Situation enables dynamic event to allow interiors again; that these events must take place with strict compliance with the proposed measures or the protocols; that this has been confirmed several times in the GEMS report; that it is particularly difficult with dynamic events to comply with the rules of social distancing and the mask obligation; that many aerosols can spread inside the interior of the facilities in which such event relates can therefore spread; that there is therefore a stricter capacity restriction during such events due to the higher risk compared to other types of events; that this stricter measure, as long as the health situation has not really improved, is therefore necessary to protect the fundamental right to the life and health of the population; In the consideration that the rules for publicly accessible events and private events in view of the introduction of new criteria may now be similar with a few exceptions, since the difference between the epidemiological effects of these situations is only slight;

that nursing services still have to be postponed in primary care and hospital care; in consideration that the total number of deaths per week last week has slightly increased by an average of 44 deaths; in the consideration that the virus circulation is still Always very high, with a significant impact on the number of new hospital admissions, which has dropped by 20 percent in the past week, but is still high; that the number of occupied hospital beds must be further reduced; that it must be prevented that it remains at such a high level that a increase in renewal, for example as a result of new variantsImmediately lead to an overload of the health care system; in the consideration that the speed at which new variants can be spread in Belgium is influenced by virus circulation; that effective measures are still required in order to reduce the effects of viral circulation and to make them more controllable; in the consideration that measures to protect the population and to reduce pressure are still necessary for the health care system, including primary care; the RAG of February 9, 2022, in which it is found that the country is still in the highest epidemiological alarm level; in consideration that the same report shows that the RAG is further improved by the health situation and the number of hospital admissions and in The intensive care of the intensive care units awaits that enable the threshold values ​​for the transition to a new phase of the barometer in the second half of February; that these threshold values ​​correspond to a transition to the phase of the above-mentioned barometer; inner consideration of the health risk for the population and the urgency that arises from the Coronavirus Covid-19; in the consideration that the Coronavirus Covid-19, which mostly resolves the lungs and the airways Insensely; that the Coronavirus Covid-19 is transferred from person to humans over the air; that the transmission of the disease apparently takes place to all possible distribution types; in the consideration that the royal decree of October 28, 2021, which is amended by the issue, contains three types of measures, namely urgent recommendations without criminal sanctions, minimum rules, which are to be observed in different locations or in differential sectors (or prevention measures that are adapted to every company in question, every association or every relevant service), and certain compulsory measures that are necessary in a limited number of areas; in the consideration that the Hygiene measures remain, for example, the special attention of the hygiene measures in sneezing and cough, hand hygiene and disinfection of the material used; in the consideration that with regard to compliance with all health recommendations and social distancing d the solidarity of every citizen is appealed; that the rules of social distancing, in particular comply with a distance of 1.5 m between the persons; in the consideration that the wearing of a mask is an important role in the containment of the spread of the virus and in the protection of people in certain facilities and in the event of certain Activities plays; that there is therefore still compulsory in certain facilities and in certain activities; that wearing a mask in all situations in which the rules of social distancing cannot be met is also urgently recommended, except for the expressly intended exceptions; in the consideration that the RAG report of February 9, 2022 shows that the number the infections in the age group of 10 to 19 year olds are still particularly high, but the incidence in the age group of 0 to 9 year olds has decreased; that it is therefore possible to abolish the mask obligation for people in primary school system; in consideration that it shows from the same report that the age group of 10 to 19-year-olds are still required for precautionary measures; That the age, from which the mask requirement applies, continues to be at 12 years of being, in the consideration that in view of the considerable circulation of the virus in youth lights, a mask of interior of schools and educational institutions is necessary from the first secondary school year in order to use the presence lessons as far as to maintain as possible and at the same time limit the strong spread of the virus within this population group; that the communities -specific conditions in relation to exceptional circumstances can be determined under which the diemask obligation does not apply; that this measure was taken into account at the request of the communities and in consultation, taking into account the principle of federal loyalty; that the measure is necessary in view of the previous and proportionate in relation to the pursuing goal, namely to combat the spread of the virus and ensure maintaining the presence lesson; and certain restrictions are subject toto maintain the fundamental right to the life and health of the population; that activities in the free room should be preferred; that it is recommended to avoid intensive contacts; that, on the contrary, the rooms have to be ventilated and ventilated sufficiently; that the opinion of the Gemsvom shows December 21, 2021 that events with larger crowds in which the hygiene measures and the rules of social distancing are not adhered to are associated with risks; in the consideration that the risk of infection in the event of non -dynamic events in which The participants of the participants sit free or assigned places and move and interact little or calmly, is apparently obvious; that this risk in dynamic events in which the participants can remain less off or move to z. B. to dance, but is higher; That the fact that an event takes place or outdoors is not the only relevant criterion for the assessment of risk degrees of these events; and not moving, apparently less; The fact that it is justified in this regard to allow one-higher occupancy for this type of horeca jobs as well as for Horeca activities that take place outdoors; -Code take place; in the consideration that events in view of the health situation are still necessary for events to take measures to take the number of participants in (large) events in both interior and outdoors; that the current favorable development of the epidemic Situation enables dynamic event to allow interiors again; that these events must take place with strict compliance with the proposed measures or the protocols; that this has been confirmed several times in the GEMS report; that it is particularly difficult with dynamic events to comply with the rules of social distancing and the mask obligation; that many aerosols can spread inside the interior of the facilities in which such event relates can therefore spread; that there is therefore a stricter capacity restriction during such events due to the higher risk compared to other types of events; that this stricter measure, as long as the health situation has not really improved, is therefore necessary to protect the fundamental right to the life and health of the population; In the consideration that the rules for publicly accessible events and private events in view of the introduction of new criteria may now be similar with a few exceptions, since the difference between the epidemiological effects of these situations is only slight; that these exceptions on the one hand, on the one hand, are based on the fundamental rights, such as the right to maintain private life and the right -wing protection of personal data, and on the other hand through the inappropriateness of certain rules of certain rules for privacy events; which represent a higher risk and non -dynamic events that pose a lower risk, the development of the health situation enables a loosening of certain measures to refer to events; that when limiting the number of people present in events, the capacity of the location where the event takes place must be taken into account; That more than 200 people may be received if the number of people received from the capacity of the Capacity of the place where dynamic events take place in interiors, and 80 percent of the capacity of the place where non -dynamic events take place and outdoor events ; that in certain cases 100 percent of the capacity may be used, especially if the guide value for interior air quality can be observed or if a layout into blocks or additional anti-crowding measures (control of crowds) in the open space; The fact that the capacity restrictions therefore do not apply to events with 200 or fewer people and the capacity of 200 people is therefore always guaranteed, regardless of the result of the air quality measurements; in the consideration that it is not possible under certain circumstances to comply with the conditions with regard to the distribution into blocks ; that in this case the local authorities can decide on the basis of additional anti-crowding measuresthat the security is still sufficiently guaranteed; that these measures can affect the avoidance of crowds both at the place of the event as well as the surrounding area of ​​this place and in relation to the associated means of transport; that in the event of such a decision the capacity restrictions do not apply; in consideration of the lower risk of events that take place, and the favorable development of the epidemiological situation, the mask obligation no longer applies to participants in such events; that this obligation continues to apply to employees and organizers of events, as is intended for the personnel during the commercial exercise of Horeca activities; Indian Raising that with regard to respect for private life, private events that take place at home or in tourist accommodation are not subject to any restrictions; in the consideration that organizers are responsible for the control of the crowd; D; Ass the local authorities are requested to monitor compliance with the strictness of measures applicable to events; that these events cannot take place if these measures cannot be kept; in the consideration that in the pursuit of coherence film screenings inkinos and congresses in view of the number of people who come together must correspond to the rules applicable to events; that the rules for congresses, depending on whether they are organized dynamically or not dynamically, therefore differ, just as for the other events; that in the collaboration agreement from July 14, 2021 it is planned that the rules for the application of the Covid Safe tickets, including cinemas and at congresses, are determined by the federated sub -areas; may gather limited number of people to avoid infection; that this restriction is justified in view of the imaginary recurring nature of these activities; That it is therefore justified in view of the Grand Number of this kind of limiting the number of people who collect on these occasions to groups of 200 people in interiors; that the applicable protocols must be held; that participants can be accompanied by two adults up to the age of 17, including and needy participants; that these two personal perspectives have been included in the maximum number; in consideration that sporting activities contribute to the spiritual and physical health of the individual; that this is not the case for these activities for these activities of approved persons in relation to organized activities; However, the fact that this high number of sports camps applies, which are treated in the same way as cultural and youth camps; However, it is strongly recommended to exercise group and contact sport as often as possible; in the consideration that the gradual cancellation of the restrictions for Horeca activities can also be continued, in particular the restrictions on the opening and closing times of the facilities of this sector, the Number of people who are allowed to sit together at one table, the obligation to remain sitting, and the mask obligation; in consideration that loosening was provided for the previously mentioned facilities in relation to the ban on the practice of commercial exercises between midnight and 5:00 a.m. are; that it is more recently that the same loosening is also intended for night shops; in the consideration that these loosening should also go hand in hand due to the favorable epidemiological situation, that in companies that have been consumers or services that offer restrictions in reference to social distancing, Group size and number of people who should be resolved in their rooms, especially in shops and shopping centers; that the size of the groups that visit the markets should no longer be limited; in the consideration that terraces or tents must meet several conditions in order to apply than outdoors or outdoors in the sense of this decree; that in both cases the air must be able to circulate free; that in cases in which these criteria are not met, these premises are located indoors or in interior areas; in the consideration that the use of air quality measuring devices (CO2) is still necessary in order to use the infection risks in the interiors of certain facilities Protects, especially in the restaurants and taps of the hotel and restaurant industry, including discos and dance locationsthe institutions of the sports sector, the infrastructures in which certain gross events take place, the cinemas and the facilities of the event sector, since due to the activities there, the spread of aerosols can be particularly high; that the air quality provisions apply to these institutions if, for example, private events, publicly accessible events or organized activities take place there; in consideration that in view of the health situation and to ensure the coherence of the applicable measures, discotheques and dance halls can be reopened; that access to discos and dance restaurants must in any case have to be organized in accordance with the modalities of the above work agreement of July 14, 2021; that this institutions comply with the Horeca rules in relation to their regular services; in the consideration that the report of the GEMS of February 10, 2022 shows that reservation of health measures in the workplace can be lifted the mandatory work in the home office be able; However, that it is still recommended to limit the presence at the workplace in order to limit contacts between people in the work environment and to reduce the number of people who use public transport at peak times; in consideration that it is recommended to be recommended to the number of contacts Reducing and using self -tests for gatherings or meetings; that the use of self -testing is useful to determine infection in good time and to prevent the spread of the virus; in the consideration that in the maximum number of people who may come together, the terms of children are also always specifically determined; in the Ravery that the recommendation (EU) 2022/107 of the Council of January 25, 2022 for a coordinated procedure to make it easier to exercise freedom during the Covid 19 pandemic and to replace the recommendation (EU) 2020/1475 A personal-based approach for travel While the COVID-19 pandemy advocates, what is used that the vaccination, test or recovery status of the traveler should be rash; that such a approach simplifies the applicable regulations and offers travelers more clarity and predictability; that people from the age of 12 who travel from another country to Belgium and do not have their main residence in Belgium have a vaccine, test or recovery certificate that exceptions must be maintained, among other things, to hinder trips within the framework of everyday life in border areas; in the consideration that to facilitate freedom of movement within Dereu, standardized validity periods and accepted types of tests that are at EU level should be determined; that it is also important for this reason to maintain the standardized period of validity of the first vaccination series and the unlimited validity of the refresher dose at the EU level; that it is also important for the same reason to maintain the standardized permanent period of the recovery certificate; in the consideration that the international traffic transport can lead to the spread of well -known and unknown variants of the virus and therefore requires a ashoption of monitoring of the adopted health regulations; that certain people still have to have a vaccination certificate in order not to be allowed to travel to Belgium as part of the framework; that such certificates show that a person against the Coronavirus Covid-13 is possible, which enables safer passenger traffic; in the consideration that a Passenger Locator form (PLF) is still filled out to be adequate monitoring and tracking travelers; that these documents serve as the basis in order to ensure the necessary contact and health monitoring by the responsible services if necessary; that this form must be filled in electronically in order to avoid in particular that there is a delay in the preservation of one-time codes for a PCR test and the necessary notification via the health measures to be followed; that the carrier is obliged to check whether all passengers have filled out the electronic version of the PLF before joining; that the airport operator must also check this on the arrival of the state; in the consideration that in view of the continued precarious health situation, the applicable restrictions are necessary to prevent a newly deteriorating situation; certain institution is violated against the provisions of the present decreeOut of public health, the administrative closure of the relevant personnel can order, among other things, in the consideration that when taking the existing measures, the effects of the application of these measures were taken into account on persons in need of protection and groups that are exposed to greater difficulties due to their health status or their personal or professional situation, to comply with health measures or to submit to these measures; that an exception to the mask obligation is provided for, for example, for example people who cannot wear an an mask or a facial protection screen for medical reasons or due to an impairment; that people in need of protection are recommended to wear vonffp2 masks that offer better protection against the virus; in the consideration that the proposed measures are required to protect the population and to continue the vaccination campaign; that in view of the current epidemic situation, the intended measures are necessary and proportionate; that the health situation is regularly evaluated; The fact that this means that stricter measures are never excluded; in consideration that the measures taken in the present decree are necessary to slow down the spread of the deromicron variant and to limit their effects on hospital recordings and the occupancy of the intensive care units;
