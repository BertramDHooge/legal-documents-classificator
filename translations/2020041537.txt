This measure therefore applies to all assessment notes that should be paid in the period in which taxpayers are confronted with reduced or non-existent income as a result of the measures to combat the Corona crisisals also for the assessment notes sent at the time of this crisis. It was pre -opted to limit the scope of the extended payment term to the assessment notification of the assessment notification before 1 October 2020. This date was determined on the basis of the exit strategy established by the Federal Government on 24 April 2020 with regard to the measures to combat the corona virus. This exit strategy states that the final phase of the restarting will take place in Deloop of the month of June 2020. Assuming that this start -up will only take place at the end of June, the last economic activities will only be activated again at the beginning of July. So the persons involved can only resume their activities in July. However, this does not mean that the income flow of companies will already start again in mid -July. After all, it is customary for a payment term of 30 days to be awarded for invoices. In some circumstances for certain sectors, this payment term can even go up to 60 days. The last restarting companies will again be able to count on a resolution of their income flow in mid -September. For the reason for tax transparency, this context is therefore opted for the extension of the payment period of payment until the end of September 2020. From October 2020, the income flow of the companies should have started new so that the extension of the payment term is no longer Meern is necessary. So, partly in the light of the security of the liquidity position of the Brussels -Capital Region, it was opted for to limit this measure to the assessment notes before 1 October 2020.

To combat aggression tax practices, this law has to convert the Directive (EU) 2018/ 822 of the Council of 25 May 2018 in the 1992 Income Tax Code, the Code of Diversity and Takes, the Code of Inheritance Tax and the Code of Registration, Mortgage and Cortians, two categories of sanctions inserted. On the other hand, in the case of the incompletely providing the intermediaries and the taxpayers concerned of the legally required information, risk a fine of 1,250 euros to 12,500 euros for such infringements made with deceptive intent or with the aim to be damaged, a fine of 2,500 euros to 25,000 euros. The legally required information is not or is provided late, the same person of 5,000 euros to 50,000 euros risk the same person. For such committed infringements done with deceptive design or to harm the purpose, a fine of 12,500 euros to 100,000 euros is imposed. The fines are recorded on the basis of the objectives of the aforementioned European Directive, which are particularly aimed at determining Sanctions that are sufficiently effective and deterrent. The difference in treatment between the two categories of sanctions is justified by the fact that it is essential that the tax authorities within the prescribed period are informed of the existence of a legal construction. In the absence of it, they cannot determine this construction on time and this would prevent them from conducting any investigation within the legal period. In this context, the King was authorized to determine the scale of the administration fund fines and to arrange their application modalities. This is the purpose of the current draft Royal Decree that records the progressiveness of the amount of the fines, taking into account the repetitive nature of the infringement committed. In its advice 67.078/3 of 8APril 2020, the Council of State made a remark (point 6 ) about the possibility that could possibly be given to the administration or judge to take into account mitigating circumstances with a view to reducing the relatively high amount of the fine in the case of, for example, spontaneous rectification of an incorrect report and thus the proportionality of to guarantee the sanction. In this context, the Council of State has referred to the case law of the Constitutional Court, in the special case to the judgment 8/2019 of 23 January 2019. The Constitutional Court indeed emphasizes when the perpetrator either a criminal fine, or An administrative fine with a criminal character, can be imposed, in principle a parall Ellism must exist between the measurement of the sanction of the sanction: if the court imposes a penalty fine for the same facts that amounts to less than the statutory minimum if there are mitigating circumstances, he must be submitted to a civil proceedings in which it is contained by a claim against the following an administrative fine, in principle have the same possibility. It is therefore not possible to dispute that a judge granted by a claim against an administrative sanction imposed by the tax administration, laid down in the implementation of the scale by this draft of Royal Decree, in In any case, a proportionality check of the amount of the fine and, if necessary, can take into account the reasons for justification and the mitigating conditions. Ing of the administrative sanctions in the scales recorded by the king, it is excluded that the sanctioning official has the same powers of the judgeThis civil servant is obliged to respect the amounts of fines set by this draft Royal Decree. This is, SIRE, the scope of the decision that Uwordt presented, I have the honor to be, Sire, Van Your Majesteit, this respectful and very Faithful servant, the vice-first minister and Minister of Finance, A.DE Crooadvies 67.078/3 of 8 April 2020 on a draft of Royal Decree "for the implementation of Articles 18, 31, 33 and 47 of the Act of 20 December 2019 Conversion of Directive (EU) 2018/822 of the Council of 25 May 2018 amending Directive 2011/16/EU with regard to compulsory automatic exchange of information in the field of notification -limit -limit -lit constructions "The Council of State, Division Legislation, requested by the Minister of Finance within a period of thirty days, extended until 9 April 2020, to provide an advice on a draft Royal Decree " n Articles 18.31, 33 and 47 of the Law of 20 December 2019 to convert Directive (EU) 2018/822 of the Council of 21 May 2018 amending Directive 2011/16/EU with regard to compulsory automatic exchange of lights in the field of taxation With regard to reporting -subject to border constructions ". The DESIGN was examined by the Third Chamber on March 26, 2020. The Chamber was composed of Jo Baert, Chamber President, Jeroen van Nieuwenhove and Koen Muylle, State Councils, Jan Velaers and Bruno Peeters, Assessors, and AnnemiegoSssens, Registrar. The report was issued by Frédéric Vanneste, first auditor. The sewage between the French and the Dutch text of the advice was checked under the supervision ofjo Baert, Chamber President. The advice of which follows below, was given on 8 April2020.1. In application of Article 84, § 3, first paragraph, of the laws on the Council of State, coordinated on January 12, 1973, the Legislation Division focused on the investigation of the authority of the statement, of the legal basis, as well as of The question of whether Forming Requirements fulfilling is met. Making the design2. The Public Prosecution Service of the Royal Decree on the Public Prosecution Service aims to set the progressive scales of the administrative fine for the non -incomplete or late provision of information with regard to a cross -border -border constructions. To this end, adjustments are made to the Royal Decree of 27 August 1993 "to implement the Income Tax Code 1992" (Article1 of the draft), the Royal Decree of 11 January 1940 "concerning the implementation of the Registration, Mortgage and Cortians Code "(Article 2), The Royal Decree of 31 March 1936" containing general regulations of inheritance tax "(Article 3) and the Royal Decree of 3 March1927" Containing the implementation of the Code of various rights and taxes "(Articles 4 and 5). Legal ground3. With the changes made in the aforementioned Royal Decrees, new provisions are implemented that were inserted in various tax law books by the law of 20 December 2019 "to convert Directive (EU) 2018/822 of the Council of 25 May 2018 Changing Directive2011/16/EU with regard to mandatory automatic exchange of information in the field of reporting lying down -border construction [s] ". For example, Articles 2 to 18 of that law of 20 December 2019 are in the 1992 Income Tax Code (hereinafter: WIB 92), items together in connection with additional reporting obligations for intermediaries or relevant taxpayers in the previous constructions - see In particular Articles - 326/1 to 326/11 of Hetwib 92 - and its sanctioning. The new fourth paragraph of Article 445 of the WIB 92 serves the Koning to record the progressive scale of the administrative fines and regulate their application mode (see the third paragraph of that paragraph). The latter provision is the legal basis for Article1 of the Decree designed. With the same goal, comparable regulations have been inserted in the Registration, Mortgage and Cortaign Code (Articles 19 to 32 of the Act of 20 December 2019), the Code of Inheritance Taxes (Articles 33 Up to 46 of the law of 20 December 2019), and the Code of various rights and taxes (Articles 47 to 60 of the Law of 20 December 2019). The other provisions of the designed Decree incorporate legal basis:- for Article 2: Article 289bis/12, Derdelid, of the Code of registration, mortgage and court fees;- for Article 3: Article132, third paragraph, of the Inheritance Tax Code;------- For Articles 4 and 5: Article 2062, third paragraph, of the Code of Various Rights and TakesPursuant to Article 61 of the Act of 20 -December 2019, those new provisions enter into force on 1 July 2020. Since its legal basis only receives legal force from that date, the entry into force of the decision to be taken must be suspended on the same reading (see comment 8). comments4. Article 24010 of the Konzinklijke Decree of 3 March 1927 is: "The fine is completely canceled: a) If the amount of the reduced fine amounts to less than EUR EUR EUR EUR EUR EUR EUR EUR EUR EUR EUR EUR EUR. . "The change of that Article 24010 that is the subject of Article 5 of the draft aims to explain that provision that, pursuant to the change, the first paragraph of that article - in application for the fines referred to in Article 2409 of the Royal Decree of 3 March 1927. That means that if the taxpayer or another notification person is obliged to justify an error - namely if he still meets the notification obligation before the tax administration intervenes or corrects a error report - he does not enjoy the automatic remission. Before that. He replied: "The main goal that by the Act of December 20, 2019 to convert Directive (EU) 2018/822 of the Council of 25 May 2018 to change Directive 2011/16/EU with regard to compulsory automatic exchange of tax area with regard to The aim of notification of notification of border constructions is intended that the tax authorities will receive correct and complete information in time with regard to cross -border constructions with a potential aggressive character. In the edge number 15 of the upper fertilizer directive 2018/822 (public magazine of the European Union of 5 June 2018) you can read that "Member Statens Sanctions must determine for violations of the national conversion provisions. Such sanctions must be effective, proportionate and deterrent ". In the edge number 7 of Diezelfdergoight line it is also read that" it is more likely that the deterrent effect that is intended with the report of possibly aggressive cross -border tax planning constructions will be reached early for the relevant information. , that is, before such constructions have actually been implemented. "For that reason, a sanction was also included for the late provision of the information. (...) A spontaneous rectification also in that this rectification is late. In view of what precedes with regard to The objective of the aforementioned directive and the fact that a sanction has been included for the late provision of the information, it did not seem to admit such remission. "5. Deregels regarding the information obligation introduced by the law of 20 December 2019 are quite complex, the periods are very short and within that time, in certain cases, a translation must also be provided for English. Due to those circumstances, the chance of violating the rules is not small. Moreover, it is for significant fines, ranging from 1250 euros to 100,000 euros, so that the sanctions to be regarded as criminal sanctions within the meaning of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. , should not be the result that mitigating circumstances cannot be taken into account at all, even in the event of a spontaneous rectification of an incorrect report. After all, an administrative sanction must be proportional, which means that the relationship between the amount of the fine and the infringement committed is not disproportionate magic (1). The possibility of taking mitigating circumstances into account contributes to the proportionality of the sanction. This is all the more necessary if the penalties like here can be particularly heavy. In general, the Constitutional Court has pointed out that if the perpetrator can be imposed for the same facts or a criminal fine, or an administrative fine, there is in principle a Parallellism must exist between demaren measures for individualization of the sanction, for example the possibility of taking into account softening circumstances: if for the same facts, the court is a criminal fine of canal who is less than the statutory minimum if there are mitigating circumstances (2), then that option must There are also in connection with the imposition of an administrative fine. does not provide for that possibility, then that difference in treatment must be reasonably responsible textunnen(3) The authorized representative has therefore been asked whether the amount of the sanctions can be reduced by the administration or by the court. The answer is: "Pulping a sanction falls under the assessment authority of the administration. She can all elements of a certain situation Taking into account to assess whether the imposition of the sanction can do, but the administration does not have a discretionary authority on the amount of the administration penalty for a specific infringement. The taxpayer may, however, apply Article 5 of the Act of 29 March 2018 expanding the assignments and reinforcement of the role of the fiscal mediation service, a reduction or remission of the administration penalties. The decision of the Regent of 18 March 1831 applies to the other laws. can judge whether the sanction is not disproportionate with the infringement. An arrest However, EST of the Court of Cassation of 13 February 2009 states the following: "However, this assessment law does not mean that the court on the basis of a subjective appreciation of what he considers reasonable, for mere reasons of opportunity and against statutory rules, penalty kankwwwschelden or reduce. "" Furthermore, the authorized representative clarified the following: "Any infringement of the tax law books, including the provisions that by the Law of 20 December 2019 2019 Conversion of Directive (EU) 2018/822 of the Council of 25 May 2018 amendment of Directive 2011/16/EUWAT concerns mandatory automatic exchange of information in the tax area with regard to a limit -to -border structures were introduced in the various laws, and Diegedaan were in principle compromised. , Articles 206 and 206bis of the Code of Registration, Mortgage and GR IFFNIGN TOOS, Articles 133 and 133bis of the Code of Inheritance Tax and Articles207 and 207bis of the Code of Various Rights and Takes apply to the provisions Vandit design that are the implementation of Articles 445, § 4, third paragraph of the WIB 92, 289bis/12, third member of the Code of Registration, Mortgage and Registrations, 132, third paragraph, Code of Inheritance Law 2062, third paragraph, Code of Various Rights and Takes. It speaks that it will not be criminal or wrong declaration or wrong declaration will be criminal prosecuted. This depends on the concrete conditions of the infringement. "And asked whether parallelism respected with criminal law, the authorized representative replied:" The principle of once to be punished for the same facts in the same space and time is of course also applicable here. The articles 450bis WIB92.206BIS/1 of the Code of Registration, Mortgage and Cortuit Rights, EN 133BIS/1 of the Inheritance Tax Code (...) apply to the provisions of this draft that are the implementation of Articles 445, § 4, third paragraph WIB 92, 289/12, third paragraph of the Code of Registration, Mortgage and Registry fees, 132, third paragraph, Code of Inheritance Taxes and 2062, third paragraph Vandiverse Rights and Takes Code. In order to prevent a convicted person from being subject to an unreasonably serious criminal case, the judge takes into account the administration fees due in the penalty provisions. to be subjected to the penalty measurement account with, among other things, the administrative fines owed. Therefore, there is no problem with regard to the principle of non -bis in idem. However, the explanation of the authorized representative offers rather than you merely opt for a tax administrative fine: will Then the possibility of imposing a fine that is less than the statutory minimum, mitigating circumstances exist? If the amount of the fine would be unreasonably high or when a criminal fine or an administrative fine become a criminal fine with regard to the same fact imposed, in view of the case law of the Constitutional Court, the judge will normally have to have the possibility. It is given to the request for consultancy to thoroughly review this matter and, if necessary, to take initiatives to get into line with the view of the view of Constitutional Court.7Once the sanction has become final, for a request for remission or reduction of tax increases or administration fines, the sanction may still appeal to the so -called granting law referred to in the Regent Decree of 18 March 1831 (4) or, what the income taxes and the various rights and taxes concerns, on the 'cell administration sanctions' founded in the lap of the tax mediation service. (5) The investigation of one -way request is reportedly "[G] Elet on the human character", not limited to the merephiscal data, but that investigation must also be taken into account "with all elements, its own intended case, They can contribute to the Minister's decision [or the tax administration], in particular the financial situation, the way in which the tax obligations are met, mitigating circumstances and reasons of humanitarian, social or other nature, large financial and/ or commercial setbacks outside the will of the person concerned and outside the framework of tax and other fraud "(6). This request for remission or reduction of tax increases and administrative fines can only be applied with regard to final tax increases and fines (7), that is, increases and fines that are no longer subject to any administrative or legal profession. (8) The possibility of ultimately appealing to the right to grace or the tax mediation service is not sufficient to safeguard the designed regulation from the aforementioned constitutional criticism. In principle, the guarantees to achieve a proportional sanctioning should be offered in the framework of the normal sanction procedure in which the tax administration or the court expresses the sanction. These guarantees may not depend on a final-reds procedure that has been called in to be able to intervene because of, in particular, humanitarian or social reasons of all appeal possibilities are exhausted. Research of the Text8. As has been noted for the discussion of the legal basis (see Note 3), the entry into force of the Temen Decree must be determined on 1 July 2020, in accordance with the legal basis.
