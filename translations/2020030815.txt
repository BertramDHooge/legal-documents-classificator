Contextzoals Numerous other economic sectors, the sector of the service checks is hit hard by the health crisis by COVID-19.. On 19 March 2020, the Brussels-Capital Government had stipulated its approval a measure to support the service checks that provide for payment of A regional intervention (14.60 euros) to the service check companies, on the basis of a reference month, in order to compensate for the performance that has not been carried out by the crisis, provided that the household assistant was put on temporary unemployment (economic or for force majeure). With this system, companies could have paid the wages of the household helpers and can have a small margin for other costs, provided that the federal government accepts a reduction in social contributions to grant employers' contributions, in order to make the system financially viable for the companies. In view of the negative response from the federal government and the National Social Security Office, another means to be found to support the companies, but also the household helpers. In this context of strongly reduced activity of the sector, it is not only to provide direct support For the recognized companies involved, but also the companies, wish to provide financial support with which they can support their household helpers, in order to ensure the preservation of their staff and thus the economic damage of this crisis. Finally, for companies that have been able to maintain a certain form of activity, sometimes in very difficult circumstances, an increased regional is provided. Details of the supporting measures can be described as follows: a. Direct-forfaitary support for companies network and for the other sectors affected by the COVID-19 crisis and the consequences thereof, a flat-rate support of 4,000 euros will be assigned to the service check companies with a registered office in the Brussels-Capital Region. will be deposited by the issue company (Sodexo) .b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.b.rest to companies with a view to support their household helpers that are temporarily unemployed by the service checks by low wages (approximately 11.65euro gross per hour, with a minimum wage of 11.07 euros gross) and a very large number of half -time relations (80%). With temporary unemployment, household helpers can be supported, but in view of the characteristics, the very large majority of them will have a monthly income of less than 1,000 euros, without All other benefits, such as meal vouchers. Thus proposed to support the household aids that depend on companies that have their registered office in the Brussels -Capital Region, and that are active in Brussels, indirectly in the vicinity of 2.50 euros gross per hour of temporary unemployment. This support will be paid by Sodexo to the companies that will request this support to deposit their household helpers at their expense. Incidentally, the companies will have to take out a withholding tax of 26.75% (such as for the benefits for temporary unemployment), what a net -benefit of 1.83 euros. That seems to be a certain way in order to comply with the guidelines of the RVA and the National Social Security Office. average gross wage of 11.60 euros per hour. If the household help is set fully economic unemployment, he or she may hope for 70% of this amount monthly, either 1,120 euros and 115 euros additional premium of the RVA (5.63 euros per working day), good for 1,235 euros. Erwes proposed to add an additional amount of 1.83 euros net per non-performed hour in the form of employment support, or 278 euros, so that a household help ultimately receives 1,513 euros per monthly jug.c. Increase of the regional intermediary is proposed, for each service check that includes performance for the period from March 18, 2020 to 30APRIL 2020, an increased regional intervention of 2 euros (16.60 euros instead of 14.60 euros per check) to knowThis support ensures that a minimum service can be guaranteed for persons who are most dependent on the activities through service checks, in particular to have their shopping done.d. Operationalization of the measuring settlement of these two support measures to companies, in order to be able to be poured as soon as possible and so efficiency, will be done via the issuing company, while the recognized companies have the bank account numbers of the employees, as well as the immediate knowledge of the number of hours temporary Unemployment performed by the latter, the payment of this allowance for temporary unemployment will carry out. The issuing company will also proceed to the payment of the increased intervention of 2 euros, but not simultaneously with the "normal" intervention, but weller via ad hoc payments. These payments have already been accepted by the issuing company as part of the assignments described in the specifications and therefore do not require formalization via an appendix (Hetis the same payment mechanism as the person used in the context of the payment of the additional indexation) .3. Advice from the Council of State and justification1. The Council of State has made a first comment on the text, in which he believes that the support of household help with the eye on the increase in their purchasing power cannot be regarded as a measure for the preservation of the employment and that this is beyond the authority granted to the Region on the basis of Article 6, § 1, IX, 8 а, of the special law of 8 August 1980 and thereby indicating that it has neither had nor the time to investigate whether there could be a legal basis for this power through an alternative view of the measure (advice 67.237/1, p. 7). The government is of the opinion that such an alternative legal basis does indeed exist for the extent that this measure should not be set for the basis If (only) a measure to retain employment, but must be considered legally as a support measure for recognized companies. Thanks to this supplement, it is true that household helpers will see their purchasing power more or less, but this is only an indirect consequence since companies that employ them will decide to use this support that is offered to them. In the first place, Bedrijfsalus are helped so that they can support the wealth of this sector - with a very high human dimension - namely hair workers. And from this point of view, the measure can therefore be qualified as "support for the companies" that entirely within the framework of the regional powers to fall from company support, and of the authority of the special law of 8 August 1980, namely the service checks referred to of Article 6, § 1, IX, 8. Not explicitly attributed to a government agency, but about which this body must have to fulfill its assignments. The negative response from the federal government to the first consideration of the first considered solution on the one hand and on the other hand the specific characteristics of the sector that is particularly characterized by a very low full -time employment rate, makes the measure of temporary unemployment d Hardly acceptable for many female employees. We therefore have to help the companies that employ them to endure this crisis as well as possible. If not, this staff may not show up in resumption of the work and this will unfortunately be a second- unfortunately economically seen more fundamental - causing crisis: without working staff, the company cannot be paid with service checks and therefore cannot survive in the short term. The profitability of certain service checking companies was already the health crisis a sensitive point. Industry can therefore indeed be qualified if support for the companies falls under the regional powers.2. The Council of State then asked to check whether the support measure for companies in the form of the intervention increased by 2 euros as referred to in Article 11 of the draft should not be registered with the European Commission. from the European Commission of which Belgium was informed in 2001 (the subsequent federal overness), which states that the registration must be traced because "the neighborhood services are not part of the trade between the Member States". As a result, no report has since been made by the federal government and this logic continued during the regionalizationSince this is a temporary increase that is added to the "main" regional intervention, there is no reason to deviate from this principile position.3.The Council of State has made some comments to adjust the text, all of which were filled up , and also to draw up a detailed report to the government in which the concrete consequences of the decision are explained (see advice, points, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14), which happened. That is why the alternative criterion in the comment In point 10 of the advice, it is not followed to be followed for operational reasons. The database of recognized companies is not based on the criterion of location unit (this remains a household name on which companies can decide whether or not to indicate at the issuing company according to their own organization), but it is indicated on the criterion of the social view. The conditions for Article 3 must be in force (see Advice, point 11). As a result of the comment in point 16 of the advice, as set out in point "d) Operationalization of the measures" of this report, it is not necessary to provide In a appendix to the cutlery. 4. Finally, in point 12 of its advice, the Council of State made a remark of compliance with the principle of equality in connection with Articles 4 and 5. However, since it is stated above that this measure must be primarily considered as a support measure for the companies, the question with regard to respect for the principle of equality between the employees in a situation of temporary unemployment is no longer an issue. The principle of equality is of course observed with regard to the recognized companies that meet the conditions for decisions, that is, with the social register in the Brussels -Capital Region. The same comment therefore applies to point 15 of the advice. Information from the Brussels -Capital Government: the Minister of Work, b.
