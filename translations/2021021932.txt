Interpreters Current multitude of taxation systems for mortgage bonds Due to the increased regionalization of natural persons and the associated complexity, FöD finance cannot underfill the data for any type of circumstances under all circumstances Mortgage bond or individual life insurance and thus ensure the shipping of the simplified explanation. Also impossible to correctly precede the data in connection with mortgage bonds and/or individual life insurance under very different confusion en, such as:- If the taxpayer is released per year before the family status is changed (marriage, divorce ...) of the tax liability,- if the taxpayer had several immovable goods a year before the relating tax year ,- If the taxpayer has taken on a bond for the purchase of an apartment in the year before the relevant tax year- in an individual life insurance contract for which the FöD finance receives several certificates, etc. The administrative door decides to provide an overview of its tax income and expenses not to send this proposal if the data in their possession is not sufficiently. Explain tion, however, are particularly enough so that a majority of the taxpayers concerned can extend the expansion of this procedure. the housing check, a regional housing bonus or a federal tax reduction for the payment of the premiums of individual life insurance. Preferent draft also aims to add a no. Must specify goods that are to be made in code 106 of the declaration of explanation, can also make a proposal to the simplified explanation. This affects both unmountable immovable goods (Art. 7 § 1 No. 1 letter a) Second streak of the EStGB 92) as well as immobile goods that are rented to natural persons, which they do not use in part to exercise their work (Art. 7 § 1 No. 2 letter a) Second thoughts of the EStGB 92) and immovable goods that are rented to legal entities are the company so that they are made available to natural persons, which they are exclusively available for residential purposes (Art. 7 § 1 no. 2 letter bbis) of the EStGB 92). Special circumstances that are similar to the circumstances described above for mortgage bonds and individual life insurance companies, but can lead to the administration not adding sufficiently secure information in order to fill the data correctly with regard to the income from immovable Guarantee. In particular, if the data in the possession of the administration shows that the tax liability, if necessary, makes expenses in connection with a tax reduction for your own apartment in the framework of mortgage bond, the proposal of the simplified explanation cannot be created with sufficient safety. In these cases, no proposal is sent. The addition of the § 2 of the KE/EStGB 92 are taxpayers, the expenditure in connection with a tax reduction for legal protection insurance premiums in accordance with Article 14549§ 1 of the EStGB 92, inserted by the law of 22 . April 2019 to facilitate the access to legal protection insurance, also contribute to the target group of taxpayers who receive a proposal of the simplified explanation. 2 - In Article 178/1 §2 of the KE/EStGB 92, the taxpayers who are free to obtain the obligation to explain on the basis of Article 178 of the KE/ESTGB 92, but would no longer want to receive the simplified explanation, either in the Electronic explanation for the previous tax year or via mymin folding suitIn view of the considerable development of the simplified explanation of the recent years, this possibility has completely lost its relevance. From the today's perfection of the proposal of the simplified explanation, it follows that around 90 percent of these proposals are not corrected by the taxpayers. Taxpayers always make them, either by returning the answer form for the proposal of the simplified explanation or directly beyond Tax-On-Web.Apfe beyond that, those affected who still want to fill out a classic statement, maintain a paper declaration or register with tax-on-web. In the latter case, the taxpayer not only has access to the electronic proposal of the simplified explanation, but also for his entire explanation in which all data known to the administration are pre -filled and which he can send to the administration. , and the administrative simplification, which is the proposal of the simplified explanation, Article 178/1 § 2des KE/EStGB 92 therefore lost its right to exist and can be repealed. 3- This article aims to make the changes contained in the draft, in particular the expansion of the taxpayers who are affected by the proposal of the simplified declaration, to enter into force. 4 - This article does not require any special commentary.
