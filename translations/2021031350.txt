However, this reference is outdated, since this law has now been canceled and the law of April 25, 2014 is currently being replaced by the status and the control of the credit institutions and the stock exchange companies. For this reason, it is intended to be used to replace the previous reference to the previously mentioned law of March 22, 1993 with a reference to the previous April 25, 2014 law .art. 105 paragraph 1 no. 1 letter e) of the KE/EStGB 92 by the royal decree of March 20, 2007 on the execution of Article 27 to Royal Decree No. 43 of December 15, 1934 on the control of the capitalization company The above royal decree No. 43 with effect from December 31, 2007.

The Flemish residential code has been changed in such a way that new local housing associations have been approved by the Flemish government since this displacement and consequently no longer approved by the "Vlaamse Maatschappij Voor Sociaalwonen". Furthermore, the power of granting certain social groups to be granted energy loan in the Flemish region has also been transferred to the energy centers.
