There is an urgent necessity because the decision of the Devlamic Government of 13 November 2020 arranges a general and selective subsidy for the organizers of childcare and extracurricular care and of measures for the families in childcare and debugging school care following the consequences of the COVID-19 virus in Article 29 stipulates that item 1 to 24 of the decision stopping to have effect on 31 March 2021. When that decision was approved November 2020, there was no clarity about the impact of the COVID-19 virusop the longer term and the elaboration of the compensation subsidy was based Iness limits time. However, it is currently certain that the coronacrisis is still not sufficiently under control and that a compensation subsidy is still necessary even after March 2021. The vaccinations have now been started. At the moment, however, only a little more than 500,000 Belgians have received a first dose, but just over 300,000 inhabitants a second dose. The federal government also still maintains destricted measures, where telework is mandatory, many sectors are closed and social contact tentot must be limited an absolute minimum. Continuous fluctuations in the infection figures and recordings in the hospital show that it is a very precarious period in which the epidemic can still go out. With these matters in mind, it is necessary that the Flemish Government Metar policy is in line with the federal measures where they aim to limit social contacts to not encourage people to make unnecessary contacts. Even more important is that the Flemish government financial liveability in the childcare sector and the sector of out -of -school care guarantees ensure that this happens even after March 2021. Since the current regulations stipulate that the compensation scheme but until the end of March 2021 applies, it is urgently necessary to approve the present decision, so that it is clear to the sectors concerned that they also count on subsidy tunnen in the period up to and including June 2021 if necessary to be. Even an advice on five days of the Council of State is not possible, since in implementation of the aforementioned decision of the Flemish Government of 13 November 2020, the Minister will have to make a decision for the end of March 2021 in which he determines before April or the general, then Welslective compensation applies.
