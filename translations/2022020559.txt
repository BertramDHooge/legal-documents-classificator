in view of the urgentness that is inspired by the need for, after the meeting of the consultation committee of 4 March 2022, as soon as possible to determine the measures contained in this Decree in order to possibly the continuity of the previously taken measures concerning the wearing of masks in trains after 10 March 2022, the date of the end of the application of the pandemie law; in view of advice; no. 71.149/4 Vande Council of State, given on 10 March 2022, in application of Article 84, § 1, first paragraph, 3 °, of the laws on the Council of VA n State, coordinated on January 12, 1973; Whereas the Expert Group Management Strategy of COVID-19 (Het Gems) advised in an advice of 28 February 2022 that Mond masksin should remain obliged to both formal threshold values ​​for Code Geelbereikt (<65 hospital admissions per day; <300 Intensive Care); Whereas the consultation committee of 4 March 2022 has decided, among other things, that wearing the mouth mask needs the train, except for the driving staff, insofar as it is well insulated in a cabin; 3 of the Law of 27 April 2018 on the police of the railways, others stipulates that everyone is present in a train, the instructions of the police and the staff of the Security Service or of the staff of the railway companies that are in uniform or distinctive of any other sign, must follow; that these instructions in the given circumstances are aimed at maintaining safety and order; that refusing to wear a mouth mask under an instruction given by the above -mentioned personnel brings the safety in the urge, and that it must therefore be consequently be considered an infringement within the meaning of the law of 27APRIL 2018 on the police of the Railways; da t the determining officials of the National Society Belgian Railways and the police services referred to in the aforementioned law are therefore authorized to determine such fractures and that, where appropriate, administrative fines can be imposed.149/4 of 10 March 2022 on the one hand is of the opinion that the prior formality to involve the regional governments in accordance with Article 6, § 4, 3 °, of the special law of 8 August 1980 for the reform of the institutions, has not been complied with, since the representatives of the Regional governments during the meeting of the consultation committee in principle have come to maintain the obligation to wear a mouth mask in public transport, but that they have not been able to deliberate collegial about this royal decree in which this chord is converted, and on the other hand that this Royal Decree is likely cannot be announced in the Belgian Official Gazette by 11 March 2022 so that it will be elaborated with retroactive force; trains IT From Article 14 of the Royal Decree of 28 October 2021, the necessary measures for administrative police in order to prevent the consequences for the public health of the announced epidemic emergency regarding the Coronavirus COVID-19 Pandemie to prevent this obligation; that that obligation no longer has an effect from 11 March 2022; The Consultation Committee of 4 March 2022 decided to maintain this obligation on the basis of the advice of the Expert Group of COVID-19 management strategy for the sake of security purposes and protection of the public health of the Belgian population; that the inter-ministerial conference of ministers of mobility of 9 March 2022, that deed has taken from the notification of the consultation committee of 4 March 2022, it has been agreed that the federal states and the federal government immediately take all necessary regulatory measures to pay as quickly as possible and urgently to the aforementioned notification; that time required for going through the procedure for adoption of royal decisions, even in the event of urgency, does not allow this Royal Decree that the continuity of wearing a mouth mask ensures trains in the Belgian Official Gazette for the higher date of 11 March2022; The consultation committee left therefore cannot be achieved when a strict application of the procedure for the involvement of regional governments and without providing retroactive effect on this royal decree, while it must be considered that, on the one hand, the presence of the representatives of the regional governments and their given agreements with regard to the preservation of the mouth mask in the trains, during the meeting of the aforementioned committee, allows to answer the purpose that is pursued in Article 6, § 4, 3 ° of the aforementioned special law of 8 August 1980 and that, other side s the need to insure a continuous mouth mask in the trainer, requires a retroactive effect for this royal decree; that the regional governments have also retained provisions in the context of their regulations that the wearing of a mouth mask in the regionally public have also retained imposing transport, which provisions are similar to the person adopted in this Royal Decree, so that this can be an implicit agreement of the regional governments in the sense that the regional governments would give negative advice on a federal provision that also applies to them of their regions; that, in the absence of retroactive effect of Dittkoninklijke, the treing users would no longer be obliged to wear the mouth mask from 11 March 2022 until the date of entry into force of this Royal Decree, date from when they should be a word mask ages, which is nonsense from the objective of security purposes protection of public health pursued by the consultation committee; on the nomination of the Minister of Mobility, we have decided and we decide: Article 1. Everyone, from the age of 12, is obliged to make the to cover mouth and nose with a mouth mask from the entering of a train operated by a railway companyContrary to the first paragraph: a), the driving staff of the railway companies are not obliged to cover the mouths, insofar as this staff is well insulated in a cabin; b) Hetmondmasker may be used occasionally for eating and drinking;c) a facial screen may be used if wearing a mouth mask is not possible for medical reasons; d) are the persons who are in the impossibility to wear a mouth mask or a facial screen in order to be a limitation, supported by means of a medical certificate, notMandatory to cover the mouth and the neute.art.2.
