The obligation to withhold the vocational tax tax remain for the 2018 income year, since the law, through the tax exemption of income from the Sharing Economy, was therefore published late in 2018 and the approved platforms therefore on a large part of the remuneration that 2018 Ferienstienst as part of the Sharing Economy were paid, withholding a vocational tax deduction. On July 26, 2018, a vocational tax advance payment was also made. Because the obligation to withhold the vocational tax deduction, fundamentally remain for the total of 2018 and is not lifted retrospectively, the income from the Sharing Economy can be retained as a preliminary deduction in accordance with Article 272 of the EStGB92 and is therefore in accordance with Article 296 of the EStGB 92 on the tax of natural persons.

Therefore, it is no longer necessary to note these income on the map in relation to the income from the sharing economy separatzu, so that the determination of Article 92/1 § 1 paragraph 1 No. 5 of the KE/EStGB 92 Non -Insight Article 53/3 § 1 of the KE/ESTGB 92. However, the preliminary deduction, which has been retained by approved platforms since January 1, 2018, still has to be on the map 281.29 for the 2018 -year income year. For taxpayers who are subject to the tax of natural persons, this advanced tax is deducted to the tax owed and, if necessary, reimbursed them. Areas who are unable to include a (mandatory or optional) declaration on the tax of the non -regional reinforcing for the 2018 income year and, if necessary, the reimbursement of professional tax deduction can apply for this tax.
