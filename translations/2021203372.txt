In the light of the Advice No 69.546/1 of 15 June 2021 of the Council of State and in view of the remarks made, some explanation is given below. The additional crisis benefit referred to in the Royal Decree of 15 September 2020 granting award , pursuant to the COVID-19 Pandemie, of an additional However, crisis benefit from some incapacitated self-employed and cooperative rights is no longer granted for the period of incapacity for work on 30 June 2021. As a result of the continuation of the COVID-19 Pandemie, the measure in this Royal Decree is extended by three months, i.e. to and by September 30, 2021. This temporary measure will perform on July 1, 2021. This retained date is determined within the strict framework of Decovid-19-Pandemie where the number of infections remains high, so that the number of people who are recognized are incapacitated for work and confronted with The risk of a financial loss, in addition, many self -employed people and cooperating spouses who perform a professional activity with the admission of the advisory physician no longer perform this activity during the disability because of an approval of the health status or the limiting measuring measure Gelen who have been accepted by the government as a result of the pandemic. Moreover, in the latter situation, a profession is not possible to claim 'crisis bridging right'. The amount of the disability benefit to which the cohabiting beneficiary can be entitled without a family burden, however, it appears that the monthly amount of the financial benefit is granted within the framework of the 'crisis bridge law' For a beneficiary without a person at the expense. This measure therefore aims to grant an additional crisis benefit to the self -employed and cooperating spouses who have the capacity as the beneficiary without family burden so that the total daily amount of the replacement income is equal to the, printed out, printed in working days, monthly amount of the financial benefit determined in the law to introduce the "crisis bridging right" ". This measure that is explicitly linked to the COVID-19 Pandemie is therefore proven to the Constitutional Equal Facial with the Constitutional equality In view of the size, seriousness and exceptional character of this COVID-19 Pandemie, so that numerous self-employed and cooperating spouses can no longer perform professional activity and only claim the performance of this benefit insurance. , the very respectful and very much sorry servants, the Minister of Social Affairs, f.

These relaxations had their elaboration from 1 March 2020 and Golden to 30 September 2020. The law granted the King the jurisdiction to a consultation council Decide to adjust the end date of this period. HELLETOP The ongoing sanitary crisis and the mandatory rules imposed on that framework to combat the Coronavirus COVID-19 extends the District of Royal Decree The period that ended 30 September 2020 now until 31 December 2021 now . In question from the Council of State, in its advice 69,328/1 of 25 May 2021, the accountability for the retroactive effect of this Royal Decree is included in the report to the King. The retroactive effect of this Royal Decree is needed for regularization of a right or factual condition, where in both fallen required and must be respected with regard to legal certainty and individual rights, for the reasons: 1. In the context of the fight against the COVID-19 Pandemie, the obligation of Telewerk, where possible.2, has been applied since October 2020.2. The organs of the Institutions for Company Pension Provision is perfectly capable of carrying out their activities and meetings, if any organizational adjustments. They have done this since October 2020, in accordance with the COVID-19 regulations. Concrete is about the work of the Councils of Directors, the operational bodies such as investment committees Social Committees, and the General Meetings.3. The regulatory framework of the IBPs, part of the law of 27 October 2006 on the supervision of the company pension institutions (hereinafter "WIBP"), its implementing decisions and the FSMA issued by the supervisory government and circular letters, as well as the statutes of various IBPs, required And/or presupposes the activities of the organs of the IBPs physical meetings. If the present Royal Decree, which in this area provides an exception to the stated regulatory framework and statutes, would have no back -working force, then all decisions and actions of the organs of the IBPsdie would be made and stated any invalid and can be disputed on that purely procedural land.4. It must be taken into account with the fact that the organs of the IBPs were in a state of apparent force majeure, since they were legally obliged to comply with the COVID-19 measures.5. This situation is a single situation that must be regularized, and this to avoid any legal disorder. In the context, the legal certainty and the individual rights are respected for the following reasons: 1. All bodies of the IBPs and all members of these bodies were treated in the same way.2.All bodies of the IBPs and all members of these organs remained able to fully exercise their powers and prerogatives.3. The operating method of the organs of the IBPs and the exercise change The powers and prerogatives of the members of these bodies was perfectly foreseeable, since it was the continuation of the practices, developed and used during the formal lockdown in the spring of 2020.4. The individual rights of the contributing companies of the IBPs (individual employers, sectors or individual self -employed people) and of the active and passive affiliates of the IBPs (current or former employees, or current self -employed) were not interrupted because it was not affected because there was no touch because The basics of supplementary pensions (with Namede Act supplementary pensions of 28 April 2003 for employees and the Program Act (i) of 24 December2002 for the self -employed, and their implementing decisions) and with regard to the financing and supervision of the IBPs (in particular the Wibp and its implementing decisions)It is these basic principles that record the rich wide of the functioning of the organs of the IBPs. If contributing companies, affiliates or the supervisory authorities would have problems with the decisions and/or acts made, their rights and the legal remedies available are protected. This is the reasons for the present Royal Decree as the date of entry into 1 October 2020 provides the honor to be, Sire, Van Your Majesty, the very respectful and very faithfuler, the Minister of Finance, v. Van Peteghemde Minister of Pensions, k. Lalieuxraad of the State Department of Legislative Advice69.328/1 of 25 May 2021 on a draft Royal Decree 'to extend the period referred to in Article 7, second paragraph, of the Act of 14 May 2020 containing exceptional measures for the Institutions for Company Pension Facilities in the context of the COVID-19 Pandemie 'On 3 May 2021, of State, the legislation department, has been requested by the Minister of Pensions within a period of thirty days to provide an advice on a draft Royal Decree' to extend the installment intended in Article 7, second paragraph , of the law of 14 May 2020 on exceptional measures for the institutions for company pension provision in the context of the COVID-19 Pandemie '. The design was examined by the Senate on May 18, 2021. The Chamber was composed of Marnix van Damme, Chamber President, Bert Thys and Wouter Pas, State Councils, Michel Tison and Johan Put, Assessors, and Greetverberckmoes, Registrar. The report was issued by Barbara Speybrouck, first auditor. The sewage between the French and the Dutch text of the advice has been checked under the supervision of Wouter Pas, State Council. The advice, the text of which follows below, was given on 25 May 2021. The Public Prosecution Service Advies the draft Royal Decree aims at the end date of 30 September 2020, stated in Article 7, second paragraph, of the Act of 14 May 2020 'containing exceptional measures for the Institutions for Company Pension Provision in the context of the COVID-19 Pandemie' to shift to December 31, 2021 with regard to the application of the provisions of Article 5, first paragraph, 2 ° and 3 °, and second paragraph, and Article 6 of the Act of 14 May 2020. The decision to be taken with effect from 1 October 2020. article 5 of the Law of 14 May 2020 stipulates that, notwithstanding another provision in their articles of association or in deviation from all other regulations on common legal persons, the institutions for company pension provision can organize and keep their general meeting through communication tools at a distance (Primary member, 2 °), including a remote vote or by a proxy (first paragraph, 3 °). The necessary documents can be sent with all possible resources (second paragraph). Article 6 of the Act of 14 May 2020 stipulates that the Board of Directors can make any decision in the case of unanimous (written) decision and that he or another operational body can also meet by means of each telecommunicatical -average, allows a joint deliberation. In accordance with Article 7, second paragraph, of the Act of 14 May2020, the aforementioned provisions were applicable during the period from 1 March 2020 to 30 September 2020.2. Before the draft, the legal basis can be found in Article 7, third paragraph, of the Act of 14 May 2020. This provision authorizes the King to be adopted by a Decree, after consultation in the Council of Ministers, the end date stated in Article 7, second paragraph, of the Act of 14 May 2020 in Tepassen. Research of the Text3. The end date in Article 7, second paragraph, of the Act of 14 May 2020 is laid down on 30 September 2020. Consequently, the provisions in Article 5, Primary member, 2 ° and 3 °, and second paragraph, and Article 6 from 1 October 2020 cannot More is applied by the Institutions for Company Pension Insurance. For a text, the date of the External Procedure Service can be postponed or canceled by means of an amendment provision, ensuring that this comes into effect at the latest on the day the text comes out of operation. After all, after that date, the text no longer exists and any change that comes into effect from that time will be aimlessly as it has no retroactive effect. If a text is no longer in force, the date on which he is out of operation can therefore only be postponed or eliminated by retroactive force in provision to the change provision and insofar as this retrospective is acceptable.14. article 2 of the design leaves the decision to be taken elaboration with effect from October 1, 2020. Happet on what is set out under 3, must, taking into account what the Steller of the draft is used, the date of September 30, 2020It should be noted that the provision of retroactive effect on decisions can only be considered under certain conditions. The provision of retroactive effect on decisions is only permissible if there is a legal basis for retroactivity, the retroactivity relates to a regulation whereby, with due observance of the Equality principle, benefits are granted or to the extent that the retroactivity necessary for the continuity or the proper functioning of the board and therefore, in principle, no obtained situations are affected. Only if the retroactivity of the designed regulation can be fitted in one of the listed cases, it can be felt. In the report, it is to the king that the designed decision has the purpose of "the extension of the period during which the Institutions for Company Pension Facilities (IBPs ) can enjoy a number of relaxation that were introduced by the Act of 14 May 2020 (...). These relaxations covered, among other things, the organization of general meetings and meetings of the operational organs of the IBPs ". The reason for the extension of the period for these relaxations is referred to "the persistent sanitary crisises the mandatory rules imposed in that context to combat the COVID-19 Coronavirus" and the elaboration date explained by the end date of 30 September 2020 that is foreseen In Article7, second paragraph, of the Act of 14 May 2020. The authorized representative, the retroactive force follows: "We believe that the retroactive effect of the draft Royal Decree to extend the period referred to in Article 7, second paragraph, of the law of 14 May 2020 holding-specific measures for the Institutions for Company Pension Provision in the context of Decovid-19-Pandemie (hereinafter respectively the draft-KB and the Law of 14 May 2020) is indeed responsibility. Although Article 7, third paragraph, of the Law of 14 May 2020 allows the king to adjust the end date with the second paragraph, it is true that this provision does not express IJK can be read as an admission by a legislative act to reiterate to a Royal Decree. In the Manual Legislation Technology of the Council of State (NR. 211, p. 127), however, reading that even if this is not the case, a Royal Decree may have retact force in one of the following two cases: (1) if necessary for the continuity of the public service or (2) if necessary for the regularization of a legal or factual situation, whereby in both cases the requirements regarding legal certainty and the individual rights are respected. We believe that in the present case the second case applies (regularization of a legal or actual situation), and For the following reasons: 1. As you know, the framework against the COVID-19 Pandemie since October 2020 applies the obligation of telewerk, where possible.2. The bodies of the company pension institutions (IBPs, being the funds and greenhouses that manage the second pillar pension schemes of employees at business and sector levels of the self-employed) are perfectly capable of carrying out any organizational adjustments, their own activities and remote meetings. They have done this since October 2020, in accordance with the COVID-19 regulations. Specifically, it is about the work of the Councils of Directors, the operational bodies such as investment committees and social committees, and the general meetings (Diedorgens take place in the first quarter of the civil year) .3. The regulatory framework for the IBPs, in particular the law of 27 October 2006 on the supervision of the Company Pension Facilities Institutions (hereinafter WIBP), its implementing decisions and the FSMA issues and circulars issued by the supervisory government, as well as the statutes of various IBPs and/or However, assumption for the activities of the organs of the IBPs physical meetings. If the draft-KB, that at this area, provides an exception to the stated regulatory framework and articles of association, would not have retroactive force, then all decisions and actions of the organs of the IBPs could possibly be invalid since 30 September 2020 and on those merely procedural land inrecht can be disputed.4. In doing so, account must be taken of the fact that the IBPs were in a state of apparent force majeure, since they were legal obligation to comply with the COVID-19 measures.5. In our opinion, this situation is a single situation that must be regularized, and this to avoid any legal messWeverliezen thereby does not forgot the precondition that the legislation of the Council of State in its advice is in sight of the Council of State. We believe that in the present case of legal certainty and individual feases are respected for the following reasons: 1. All bodies of the IBPs and all members of these organs were treated in the same way.2. All bodies of the IBPs all members of these bodies remained able to fully exhibit their powers and prerogatives.3. The operating method of the organs of the IBPs and the exercise method of the powers and prerogatives of the members of these bodies was perfectly predictable, since the Public Prosecution Service developed the continuation of the practices and used during the formal lockdown in the spring of 2020.4. The individual rights of the sponsors of the IBPs (individual employers, sectors or individuals are) and of the active and inactive members of the IBPs (current or former employees, or current self-employed people) were not compromised because there was no touch to the substantive Regulations on supplementary pensions (in particular the supplementary pensions of 28APRIL 2003 for employees and the Program Act (i) of 24 December 2002 for the self -employed, and their enforcement decisions) and on the financing of and supervision of the IBPs (in particular the WIBP and its implementation decisions). It is this substantive regulations that record the substantive range of the operation of the organs of the IBPs. If sponsors, members or the supervisory authorities would have problems taken with the decisions and/or the acts made, then their rights are protected from them available to them.
