The Chamber was composed of Marnix van Damme, Chamber President, Wilfried van Vaerenbergh and Chantal Bamps, State Councils, Michel Tison and Johan Put, Assessors, and Wim Gevents. The report was issued by Githa Scheppers, first auditor. Between the French and the Dutch text of the advice was checked under supervision Vanchantal Bamps, State Council. The advice, of which the text follows below, was given on 8 July 2020.1. With application of Article 84, § 3, first paragraph, of the laws At the Council of State, coordinating top January 12, 1973, the legislation department focused on the investigation of the authority of the Steller of the Trade ING, from the legal basis, as well as the question of whether the formal requirement to be fulfilled. On the one hand, the Public Prosecution Service of the Royal Decree on the one hand determines the entry into force of the law of 17 March 2019 `concerning accountant and tax advisor 'on the date of 30 September 2020 (Article 1 of the draft) and on the other hand the cancellation of the law of 22 April 1999 `concerning the accounting and tax professions' on the same date, with the exception of Articles 45/1, § 2, § 7, 3) to 5) and §§ 8 to 14, 45/2 and 51, § 1, first paragraph, and § 2, of that law (Article2). Previously, the composition, the workings of the authority of, on the one hand, the internship committee (exam jury) of the professional institute of recognizing bookholders and tax specialists (BIBF) and, on the other hand, the executive rooms and the rooms by profession of Hetbibf, as well as the assignment of these bodies or the stage and the disciplinary scheme of the Bibf vocational practitioners and the BIBF trainees. In the sixth, seventh and eighth paragraph of the In this context, reference is made to Article 124, § 2, of the law of 17 March 2019, that the interns of the BIBF allow their internship to continue under the same conditions, and corresponding rules provided for by or to implement the law of 22 April 1999. (1) 3.1. For the designed scheme, the legal basis is derived from Articles 129, 1 °, and 130, of the law of 17 March 2019, on the basis of which the King is authorized to determine the date on which the law of 22 April 1999 is being held (2) and the law of 17 March 2019 will enter into force (with the exception of Articles 127 to129 that come into effect on 1 June 2019) .3.2. For the transitional arrangement, an additional occupation will have to be made on Article 108 of the Constitution, to which the King a general implementation authority deprivation of the TEKSENSHEF4. In view of what has been noted under 3.2 in connection with the legal basis, a new first paragraph must be added in the preamble of the draft, in which reference is made to Article 108 of the Constitution. Final remark 5. From the request for advice attached of 14 May 2020 of the Supreme Court for the Economic Professions, it appears that there is a need for a clear transitional arrangement for certain hanging files and current internships.5.1For example, the advice states that with regard to the disciplinary files who are pending against IAB (3) members, the provisions of the law of 22 April 1999 `concerning the professional stage for accountants and tax consultants', both in terms of the composition of The disciplinary organs, as the procedural rules, remain appropriate that for the disciplinary records against BIBF members, the regulations from the Law of 22 April 1999 in question the accounting and tax professions', which relate to the composition and deprocedure rules of the executive rooms and The Chambers of Appeal of the BIBF, as well as the regulations withdrawn in the Royal Decree of 28 November 2018 `to determine the rules regarding the organizations the operation of the professional institute of recognized accountants and tax specialists' remain applicable. When an appeal is lodged after the entry into force of the law, the new regulation from the law of 17 March 2019 in connection with the Appeals Committee and that, in the context of the entry into force of the Act, it is nowhere stipulated that the new institute must provide necessary resources for the execution of the assignments of the existing disciplinary organs during the transition period. To that Advies emphasizes that, notwithstanding corresponding article 122 of the law of 17 March 2019, it is explicitly stipulated that the hanging disciplinary files are treated by the disciplinary organs "in the same composition", from this it cannot be deduced that this authorities will continue, even if the period for which the members would of these bodies have been named. What these hanging disciplinary files (4) are concerned with the authorized to see the following interpretation: "It is indeed intended that the disciplinary organs of the Beidefusioning Institutes continue to treat their pending disciplinary files after entering into the Act of the Act 17 March 2019. that The disciplinary organs of the BIBF that continue to do in the same composition is settled in Article 23 of the draft law containing various provisions on the economy that is present for your council (file 67560) and that Article 122 of the Act of 17 March 2019 wants to change. That article 23 is in design: "The mandate of the members of the disciplinary organs and of the legal assessor at the professional institute of recognized accountants and tax specialists is extended to the date on which dedossers who are handled with those organs were handled.". In this way it is guaranteed that the hanging files continue to be treated in the same way and the same persons in the entry into force of the law, in the interest of the member concerned. The current mandates at the BIBF run until 2023 and Diebij the IAB until 2024. The files in research that have not yet been brought to a disciplinary organ are transferred to the legal assessor referred to in Article 90 of the Act of 17 March 2019 ".5.2 . For the files on supervision and quality control hanging at the merger institutes on the date of the law of 17 March 2019, the aforementioned advice will point out the uncertainty or further dealt with by the existing bodies/committees, or whether this hanging files for further Treatment are transferred to the newly compiled bodies/committees. Asked for the approach to the files on supervision and quality control date of entry into force of the Law of 17 March 2019, the authorized representative answered: "SOWN King does not implement Article 60 of the law of 17 March 2019, the current rules in the quality procession will remain Sing (Royal Decree of 9 December 2019 to record a regulations in the quality test of the external members of the institute of the auditors and the tax consultants until further regulation of the use of the assignment letter) apply. The quality testing system system in the law of 17 March 2019 is also building on the existing system that today only applies to the members of the IAB. So nothing changes for them. The members of the BIBF that will become members of the IBA will only be subject to the rules on quality assessment within four years ".5.3. The aforementioned advice states that the provisions of Articles 24 to 26 of the Act of 22 April 1999, it is stated as well as the implementing decisions in connection with the IAB internship are not retained with the eye on the transitional arrangement for IAB trainees and it is emphasized that, on the one hand, the legal certainties are not served by a different approach, depending on BIBF-Stagiasof IAB -Stagices and, on the other hand, the organs who are responsible for the follow-up of the IAB trainees must also be able to continue to function during a transition periodThe question why in the draft decree the provisions of the law of 22 April 1999 `concerning the accounting and fiscal professions' (Articles 24 to 26 of the draft), as well as the implementing decisions in connection with the IAB internship are not retained for the time being with In view of the transitional arrangement for IAB trainees (this in contrast to the BIBF trainees), the authorized representative gave the following clarification: "The law of 17 March 2019 changes the rules and conditions for the current BIBF trainees drastically. Value at the BIBF is one year today, it will be three years at the IBA. Therefore, the current BIBF trainees can continue their internship according to the current rules. The IBA will have to provide the needy measures and resources until when the last BIBF-Stagia on that way his internship has completed. The situation is different for the current IAB members. For them, in fact, nothing changes or nothing. If the law of 17 March 2019 changes EFT applied, they are intended to clarify the current rules without weighing them up ".5.4. In view of the foregoing and because of the clarity and legal certainty, it is recommended that the scaffolders of the draft supplement the design scheme with a transitional arrangement, which is determined on the one hand, that on the date of the entry into force of the law on discipline and supervision and Quality control the same thing will be treated respectively with the disciplinary organs and at the merger institutions their existing composition and, on the other hand, that the current IAB internships can be continued under the same conditions and rules provided for by or for the implementation of the law of 22 April 1999, where the bodies who are responsible for the follow-up of the IAB trainees, can continue to function accordingly.

(2) Article 129, 2 °, of the law of 17 March 2019 will not be carried out for the time being. The authorized representative made this connection: "The law of 22 April 1999 on the professional stage for accountants and tax consultants is not provisionally abolished. The provisions of this Act will continue to apply and are necessary for the handling of the files that have been brought to the disciplinary organs established by this Act ".

The quality testing system system in the law of 17 March 2019 is also building on the existing system that today only applies to the members of the IAB. So nothing changes for them. The members of the BIBF that will become members of the IBA will only be subject to the rules on quality assessment within four years ".5.3. The aforementioned advice states that the provisions of Articles 24 to 26 of the Act of 22 April 1999, it is stated as well as the implementing decisions in connection with the IAB internship are not retained with the eye on the transitional arrangement for IAB trainees and it is emphasized that, on the one hand, the legal certainties are not served by a different approach, depending on BIBF-Stagiasof IAB -Stagairs and, on the other hand, the bodies that are responsible for the follow-up of the IAB trainees must also be able to continue to function during a transitional period.
