In the light of the Advice No 69.546/1 of 15 June 2021 of the Council of State and in view of the remarks made, some explanation is given below. The additional crisis benefit referred to in the Royal Decree of 15 September 2020 granting award , pursuant to the COVID-19 Pandemie, of an additional However, crisis benefit from some incapacitated self-employed and cooperative rights is no longer granted for the period of incapacity for work on 30 June 2021. As a result of the continuation of the COVID-19 Pandemie, the measure in this Royal Decree is extended by three months, i.e. to and by September 30, 2021. This temporary measure will perform on July 1, 2021. This retained date is determined within the strict framework of Decovid-19-Pandemie where the number of infections remains high, so that the number of people who are recognized are incapacitated for work and confronted with The risk of a financial loss, in addition, many self -employed people and cooperating spouses who perform a professional activity with the admission of the advisory physician no longer perform this activity during the disability because of an approval of the health status or the limiting measuring measure Gelen who have been accepted by the government as a result of the pandemic. Moreover, in the latter situation, a profession is not possible to claim 'crisis bridging right'. The amount of the disability benefit to which the cohabiting beneficiary can be entitled without a family burden, however, it appears that the monthly amount of the financial benefit is granted within the framework of the 'crisis bridge law' For a beneficiary without a person at the expense. This measure therefore aims to grant an additional crisis benefit to the self -employed and cooperating spouses who have the capacity as the beneficiary without family burden so that the total daily amount of the replacement income is equal to the, printed out, printed in working days, monthly amount of the financial benefit determined in the law to introduce the "crisis bridging right" ". This measure that is explicitly linked to the COVID-19 Pandemie is therefore proven to the Constitutional Equal Facial with the Constitutional equality In view of the size, seriousness and exceptional character of this COVID-19 Pandemie, so that numerous self-employed and cooperating spouses can no longer perform professional activity and only claim the performance of this benefit insurance. , the very respectful and very much sorry servants, the Minister of Social Affairs, f.
