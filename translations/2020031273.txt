After this evaluation, an extension, whether or not in an adapted form, of this temporary measure bridging rights support of the Restart after 31 October 2020, is the possibilities. The extension of the temporary crisis measure for the right of bridging aims at the extension of the allocation of a replacement income of a monthly amount of 1,291.69 euros (1,614.10 euros in the event of a burden) to the following self -employed persons: • Self -employed people who have to interrupt their activity in all or partly due to closures and restrictions imposed in the ministerial decision of 23 March 2020 on urgent measures to distribute the distribution of the Coronavirus COVID-19 to limit the subsequent decisions and in particular the ministerial decision of 30 June 2020 (the COVID-19 decisions). It is therefore about the sectors that remain closed after the fourth Fasevan de Restart, or • The self -employed whose activity whose activity mainly depends on the above -mentioned activities and sectors. In addition, the temporary measure bridging rights to support the restart is extended until 31 October 2020. Net Such as the temporary crisis measure for bridging rights, it concerns the allocation of a replacement income for a monthly amount of 1,291.69 euros (1,614.10 euros if family burden). Below the conditions are still reminded: 1 ° are active in one of the sectors that the object of the closing measures imposed by the COVID-19 decisions for at least one full calendar month (from the end of March to at least early May), 2 ° only From May 4, 2020 (or later), Humanctivity have been able to restart without restrictions than the social distancing rules. This includes the following sectors: • The hospitality industry • Non-food detail trade (with the exception of do-it-yourself -Affairs and garden centers that were already reopened in April and the daily newspaper traders that were also open in April) • The markets • Hairdressing Beauticians 3 ° for the quarter prior to the month for which the application is made, a decrease of at least 10% of the turnover or turnover of the orders in respect of the same quarter of the previous year (for the month of June it concerns the quarter of the month on which d e application). This condition will be used flexibly for the self -employed who are less than an annual active. After all, they do not yet have this reference quarter and will have to be able to demonstrate the reduction on the basis of the first full quarter of the activity (for example when one has only started its independent activity in September 2019) or the first -class calendar months of the activity (if one for example one Only on 20 February his activity start and there is no full quarter preceding the application); 4 ° for the relevant month no benefit in the context of the temporary crisis measure to enjoy the Bridging Right on the basis of a different provision in the law of 23 March 2020. In the advice 67.916/ 1/V of 7 August 2020, the Council of State has made the comment under points 5.1 t.e.m. 5.4 That it must be clearly a justified why the measure referred to in Article 4bis, § 1, of the Act of 23 March 2020 does not extend, in contrast to the measure referred to in Article 4bis, § 2, of the same know this in the light of the principle of equality . The essential difference between Article 4bis, § 1, and 4bis § 2, it is that Article 4bis, § 1, the self-employed intends to carry out dysis that were not explicitly prohibited/limited by the COVID-19 decisions, but de facto de experience consequences of the COVID-19 crisisIn the period of general lockdown wax this protection required to protect these self -employed people against the secondary consequences of decrisis. From 4 May, a step-by-step rollout of the exit strategy was proceeded. In this context Article 4bis § 1, extended up to and including 31 August 2020 by the Royal Decree No.41 of 26 June 2020 amending the law of 23 March 2020 amending the law of December 22, 2016 containing a bridging right to the Great from the self-employed and to introduce the introduction of temporary measures in the context of COVID-19 in favor of the self-employed to protect these self-employed persons. However, the aforementioned activities can take place in a normal way after August 2020 without other disadvantages in comparison with any other independent activity that can be exercised during this COVID-19 crisis. Those who still fall under a limitation of a decision of the National Security Council will be able to appeal to the measure referred to in Article 4bis, § 2. The latter also applies to the sectors or activity die depends on these prohibited or limited activities. In view of the measures taken during the National Safety Council of 27 July 2020, it is clear that again a large number of activities fall under these obligatory, entire or partial, closure and thus can still enjoy the temporary crisis measure bridging right. The notion 'dependent on these activities' meets the self -employed people who fall outside the explicitly prohibited or limited activities, but are dependent on the latter in Sterkemate. A phase of gradual restart also implies that certain support measures are being reduced, all the more so the activities that Not explicitly prohibited or limited, do not suffer disadvantages from the COVID-19 crisis to the same extent. The steener conditions of 1 July 2020 for the measure under Article 4bis, § 1, also resulted in the number of cases that can rely on this measure is greatly reduced. All this will be viewed in the light of the cessation of this part from 1 September 2020. Watprage the comment of the Council of State in the same advice, under 6.1 and 6.2, with regard to the additional measures that are currently included in the police regulation of the Governor of the ProvinciStwerpen of 5 August 2020 `With regard to additional measures in the fight against the Coronaviruscovid-19 ', the provision in the law of 23 March 2020 is clear. Also the additional regional lockdown measures under the measure of Article 4bis, § 2, that "the self -employed people who are forced to interrupt their activities partially or in full and insofar as their activities directly observe the activities as referred to in the Ministerial Decree of 23 March 2020 and any other later ministerial decision-containing urgent measures to limit the distribution of the Coronavirus COVID-19 "aims at at least implicitly that all provisions that limit or prohibit an activity in the COVID-19 crisis can give rise to the application of these measure. Since items 9 and 23 of the Ministerial Decree of 30 June 2020 on urgent measures to limit the spread of the Coronavirus COVID-19, clearly give the possibility of the local authorities to take additional (preventive) measures, these additional measures should also as sufficient land to be considered to grant the measure in accordance with Article4bis, § 2, of the Act of 23 March 2020. Articles of provisions Meeting article 1 implements a number of technical adjustments in Article 6 of the Act of 23 March 2020. ENTERZIJDELLENT Section 1 The basic conditions of the temporary crisis measure Bridging rights up to and with December 31, 2020.Paragraaf 2 of the same article replaces in Article 6, § 1, deeparts under 5 ° and 6.
